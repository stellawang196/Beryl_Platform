2025-04-03 20:18:42,$128K Gain By Using Common Sense,CultureForsaken3762,10,"Feeling liberated today.  Vindicated for sure.  EVERYONE in the media and most people here on WSB were telling me that “tariffs were just a negotiating ploy”.  However, I knew that 🥭 had been talking about tariffs for decades.  I knew that the people around him in Admin 2.0 was drastically different than Admin 1.0.  I decided to take 🥭 at his word while everyone else “hoped” for the best.  Hope is not a strategy and today it showed.

I knew that even 10% tariffs across the board would be devastating for company earnings.  The fact the tariffs came in that much worse was just extra gravy for my hedged portfolio.

I used puts mostly but also had calls on GLD, IBIT, NVDA and OKLO as a partial hedge to my short positions.

I’m still heavily net short as I anticipate retaliatory tariffs will be applied by other countries.  I expect these headlines to drop intermittently over the next few weeks so I think upside for the major indices is effectively capped at maybe 3-5%.

Good luck to everyone out there.  Stay hedged.",https://i.redd.it/zrlddctlhose1.jpeg,https://i.redd.it/zrlddctlhose1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jqt1ji/128k_gain_by_using_common_sense/

So apparently we priced in Armageddon but not Super Armageddon. I was floored when I saw what was unveiled on Liberation Day. Yall can clown on me for being wrong in my DD when I said no one cares about tariffs. HOWEVER, this does not change my opinion on Robinhood. I figured it was a good idea to estimate what the option bids were going to be on open so I could sell at a small loss and open a position on Monday when the options prices lowered to dirt cheap. I was tired of getting manhandled by theta on my calls, so I went all in on one massive call that got hammered in price recently.

Main events I am watching is JPOW tomorrow because I have some FDs for Friday not big enough to post, Earnings smash on 4/30, possible S&P 500 inclusion in early June, crypto event this summer, more prediction markets for major leagues possible.

Buying options at dirt cheap and continuing my contrarian idea because everyone thinks the bear market is guaranteed this year, so logically they all aren’t allowed to be right.

I will still keep my promise if Robinhood goes to $100 by the end of June, I will still donate $5k to the Autism Society and meet Vlad in person.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqlme1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jqlme1/robinhood_hood_yolo_part_2/

2025-04-03 11:31:07,[DD] How to Profit Off the Trade War [$500k invested],Steve_Zissouu,312,"Hello everyone,

This morning, I wanted to discuss the implications of the trade war for your investment strategies. I get the sense that many of you are misunderstanding what is happening right now. Retail investors consider this to be the beginning of a bear market. But they don’t realize that a bear market in one sector can mean tremendous opportunity in another. Institutional investors consider this to be the beginning of a major sector rotation into a sector that has been massively undervalued and neglected: American industry, energy, and materials. I am going to explain how you can come to understand all of this as an opportunity.

Those that follow my last few posts on mining, infrastructure, energy transitions (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/) and, most recently, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j42h15/blackrock_made_a_move_on_panama_ports_theyre/))  know that I have been anticipating continued actions (including steep tariffs) by the present administration to combat Chinese influence over critical mineral and metal supply chains. My entire portfolio has more-or-less been restructured from the beginning of the  term with this background assumption in mind. My research over the last months has focused on understanding which companies stand to benefit from increased import/export controls. Again, my emphasis is on domestic metals, minerals, and mining specifically.

**I. Context Setting**

My thesis remains fundamentally unchanged. It is as follows:

>**Thesis/Summary:** the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present US administration and hopefully beyond. The investments that will matter most have to do with the processing, extraction, separation, and manufacturing of titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals deemed critical. These investments must be allied with western interests, ideally operating in the United States. The issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance China has over these metals and rare earth minerals. 

In the past, I have supported this position by examining the present administration’s executive orders, legislative agenda, as well as conducting an analysis of major hedge fund and institutional holdings beginning 2024 Q4. In this post, I will instead point out the general features of my most treasured investments which have earned them the right to exist in my portfolio. 

As I explained previously, my methodology for investment decisions have been guided by the following principles:

1. First, priority should be given to domestic companies looking to mine, refine, and develop critical metals/minerals in the USA or who may be substantial suppliers of our critical minerals stockpile. Secondary priority should be given to those companies part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and/or within Canada, and wishing to mine, refine, or develop critical metals/minerals in the USA, or who may be stockpile suppliers.
2. Priority should be given to companies that have substantial federal contracts already or have projects presently awaiting government permits, funding, or regulative actions, where such action would be expressly in the USA national security interest.
3. Priority should be given to companies that have institutionally and politically well-resourced members involved in their board, leadership, governing body.
4. Priority should be given to companies represented unusually strongly in the portfolio of major hedge funds, have unusual levels of insider activity, and/or are represented in the financial disclosures of politicians in Washington, D.C.
5. Priority should be given to companies that have established they can deliver results or who have a head start in their particular niche of the industry relative to competitors.

It should be rather straightforward to see how it is, exactly, that these considerations could lead one to investment strategies that will be shielded from international export/import controls. 

Let me run you through one example of an investment choice I have made that has aligned with the considerations above: **MP Materials.** The company is entirely focused on the domestic US supply chain for rare earths and minerals critical to national security, energy, transportation, technology, and so on. They are also the *only* company in the entire US that is vertically integrated: able to not only mine materials, but also to refine and process them, etc.

They have massive [federal funding contracts](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/dod-awards-35-million-to-mp-materials-to-build-us-heavy-rare-earth-separation-c/), their CEO is extremely well-connected, institutional holdings increased massively in Q4 2024 ([Blackrock took a 10% stake;](https://fintel.io/i/blackrock) Australia’s richest woman, Gina Rinehart, who is a close friend and supporter[ of Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/gina-rinehart-anthony-pratty-donald-trump-us-newspaper-ads-inauguration), took a 9% stake in the company through her investment fund, Hancock Prospecting).  In addition to all of this, MP has [scaled quickl](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx)y in both their early supply chain (mining-side) sector, as well as mid-stream, having recently begun operations of a new refining facility in TX. 

In my view, MP has the domestic side of this sector backed into the corner. It’s not even close.

**II. Positions Explained**

What are the rest of my positions? It is a mixture of stock/equity and delta-focused derivatives (I only hold calls, not puts). I love leveraged positions, generally. Anyways, here are my holdings, though they do not include my HSA investments. You can ignore RDDT, UPS, AMZN. Those are unrelated.

Briefly, here are few of what I consider my top holdings and what they do:

1. MP: Heavy Rare Earth Mining, Processing, Magnets
2. UUUU: Uranium and Titanium
3. LAC: Lithium/batteries
4. ABAT: Lithium Battery & Recycling
5. VAL: Deepsea mining infrastructure.

I know this is a scary time for a lot of people. Please do take a breath and consider how you think the next few years will unfold, carefully. I hope my post is useful to some of you and I welcome further thoughts on investment strategies in this brave new world.

I bought these put spreads before close, then when I saw SPY was around $551 after trump pulled out his tariff bingo card, I called my brokerage to exercise the 559 puts. 

They told me on the phone it was possible the other party would not exercise their $558 puts. I thought yeah right, they're like $9 ITM but okay whatever I'll take the risk.

2025-04-03 10:49:39,The most important move in the markets right now in my opinion is...,mnelso32,239,"the US dollar index (ticker $DXY). It's down around 2% right now in the premarket:

https://preview.redd.it/4tww7exmnlse1.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=79dac309346ec443300b54ecc4fb418ea3284481

What does this mean? To me this likely means foreign investors are pulling out of US markets because of all of the uncertainty related to tariffs. Note that imports become even more expensive when the dollar weakens. One thing to keep in mind however is that the US dollar index is still at a normal level historically speaking:

https://preview.redd.it/jt2kam9pnlse1.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd17ff410e78d980037baf8d5b97ea25751929b

As you can see, the US dollar index has bounced off the $100 level over the past few years multiple times. A big reason for this is because the dollar rises when the Fed raises rates. However the Fed can't realistically raise rates at the moment without tipping the US into a recession, so I don't know how much they can do to support the dollar if it falls below $100.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jqf8an/the_most_important_move_in_the_markets_right_now/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jqf8an/the_most_important_move_in_the_markets_right_now/

I think everyone seems to be forgetting that big tech will begin facing budget constraints due to tariffs which will slow down their AI investments until the Ai sector figures out how to shift production components away from china. Since AI hardware is capital intensive it only makes sense that big tech will be temporarily forced to cut major purchases until they’ve gained more clarity on cost structures. It’s likely big tech customers (who make up a big chunk of AI revenue) will find ways to make supply chain adjustments so that they don’t fall behind to their competitors…but this adjustment period will significantly cause delays and potential slow down in order volumes from chip and data centers as companies figure out  how to reduce exposure to tariffs(in the short term). I am bullish long term but I think this logistical issue will get in the way of good earnings in the next few quarters on all our favorite AI stocks.

Historical Bear Market Percentages: 

 * Average Decline: The average bear market sees a decline of around 35%. However, this can range from just over 20% to nearly 90%.
 * Smallest Decline: Some bear markets have had relatively small percentage declines, such as the one in July 1990 which saw a drop of approximately 19.9%.
 * Largest Decline: The most severe bear market on record was during the Great Depression, where the S&P 500 plummeted by approximately 83% between 1929 and 1932. Other significant declines include the bear markets of 1973-1974 (-48.2%) and 2007-2009 (-56.8%).
Historical Bear Market Durations:
 * Average Duration: The average bear market lasts about 15 months. However, durations have ranged from a few weeks to several years.
 * Shortest Bear Market: The shortest bear market occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lasting only 33 days.
 * Longest Bear Market: The longest bear market coincided with the Great Depression, spanning from 1929 to 1932, a period of almost 3 years. Other lengthy bear markets include the one from 2000-2002 (31 months) and 1973-1974 (21 months).

The EU is preparing a response to the US duties. Brussels is considering a complete market closure for American goods, [El País](https://elpais.com/internacional/2025-03-31/bruselas-respondera-sin-lineas-rojas-a-los-aranceles-de-trump-a-los-productos-europeos.html?event_log=go) reports.

The European Union is preparing to retaliate against the introduction of new duties by the Donald Trump administration, which will come into force on April 2.

Brussels is considering the possibility of using a full arsenal of measures, including restricting the access of American companies to the European market and public tenders. This was reported by a source of El País in the EU.

The new US customs tariffs, which Trump calls ""reciprocal,"" could seriously affect trade relations between the two sides of the Atlantic.

According to the US administration, the annual volume of imports and exports between the US and the EU reaches 900 billion euros, with a trade balance of 235.5 billion euros in favor of Europe.

In response, the European Commission is considering tough measures, including imposing tariffs on American goods, restricting access to European financial markets, and even banning American companies from participating in EU-funded projects.

At the same time, European capitals, including France, Italy, and Ireland, are calling for a cautious approach to avoid a full-blown trade war.

Despite the escalating situation, Brussels continues to try to negotiate with Washington. The EU is even offering some concessions, including lower duties on industrial goods and increased purchases of American liquefied natural gas.

However, if the US does not abandon the new customs restrictions, Europe is ready to act without red lines.

# Europe's reaction

During his recent visit to the United States, French President Emmanuel Macron advised his American counterpart, Donald Trump, [not to start a trade war with Europe](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/macron-tries-to-dissuade-trump-from-imposing-1740497672.html). Instead, he urged him to focus on China.

The French President also made it clear to Trump that Europe would not be able to increase defense spending, as demanded by the United States, in the event of a trade war.

In addition, the [EU promised to respond to Trump in the event of a trade war](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/eu-pledges-to-respond-to-trump-in-case-of-1738588087.html).

(Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering revoking tariff exemptions for low-value shipments from China, known as ""de minimis,"" as part of Wednesday's tariff announcement, a source familiar with the plans said.

The de minimis rule allows goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without tariffs, a loophole that has benefited Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. Revoking this exemption would align with broader efforts to counter China's trade practices and strengthen U.S. manufacturing.

The tariff measures, set to be announced Wednesday, include a 25% tariff on automobile imports beginning April 3, with additional duties on auto parts expected to follow. The administration argues that these tariffs will help protect domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers.

""We are taking strong action to ensure American businesses compete on a level playing field,"" a senior White House official said.

However, critics warn that these moves could have unintended consequences. Some economists estimate that tariffs could increase costs for American consumers, with one analysis suggesting that U.S. households could pay an additional $3,400 annually. Trading partners, including the European Union, have expressed concern, with some considering retaliatory tariffs that could further strain global trade relations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jpy2js/trump_considering_revoking_tariff_exemptions_for/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jpy2js/trump_considering_revoking_tariff_exemptions_for/

2025-04-02 15:55:43,Rivian posts sharp fall in quarterly deliveries as soft demand weighs,callsonreddit,227,"(Reuters) - Rivian reported a 36% decline in first-quarter deliveries on Wednesday, as the electric-vehicle maker grapples with weak demand, sending its shares down nearly 6%.

EV makers have been battling tough demand as consumers opt for cheaper hybrid and gas-powered vehicles in an uncertain economic and political environment.

""I would say the sector at the moment is out of favor. Over the medium to long term, EVs are still inevitable, and so it's just going to take some time for these companies to continue to ramp up,"" said Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough had said in February vehicle deliveries would be lower this year due to soft demand, partially because of the impact of fires in Los Angeles.

Demand could be further pressured as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are expected to accelerate inflation and increase prices of automobiles, making consumers wary of committing to big purchases.

Sheppard said Rivian's margins would be affected by tariffs, and it could face a larger hit from the duties as opposed to bigger players such as Tesla.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe had said earlier this year the company expects higher costs from tariffs on Mexico and Canada as it has a supply chain footprint in these countries.

The company delivered 8,640 vehicles in the quarter ended March 31, down from 13,588 a year earlier. But the deliveries exceeded analysts' estimate of 8,200, according to Visible Alpha.

Tesla reported a 13% slump in quarterly sales, its weakest performance in nearly three years, as backlash to CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics grows and consumers seek out newer models from rival EV makers.

Rivian produced 14,611 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 13,980 a year ago. It reaffirmed its annual deliveries forecast.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-reports-fall-first-quarter-123133853.html,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jps2rr/rivian_posts_sharp_fall_in_quarterly_deliveries/

2025-04-02 14:02:57,Nvidia-backed CoreWeave is the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021,satireplusplus,118,"We've got a fresh IPO that just hit Nasdaq last Friday and options already trade on this! CoreWeave / $CRWV is a Nvidia-backed cloud AI services provider. $CRWV is one of the first pure-play AI IPOs, offering AI technology in the cloud. It's backers: Nvidia, Fidelity, and Magnetar. Nvidia even anchored the IPO with a $250 million order. 

Financials: CoreWeave raised $1.5 billion in its IPO, the most for a U.S. tech offering since 2021. Revenue last year was $1.92 billion, up 737% from the year before. Growth is undeniable, but there's also a net loss of $863 million reported last year. (D'uh).

Strong Customer Base: Microsoft, Meta, IBM, and Cohere are all customers. Microsoft alone accounts for 62% of CoreWeave's revenue.

The IPO priced below the expected range, opening at $39 and closing at $40. Friday was a shitty day (-3% nasdaq) to IPO.

So, what's the play?

This isn't a short-term YOLO imho, IV is so high it's only good for writing puts. Shares for me, but you do you. Also do your own DD, obviously. Current market price is still kinda close to IPO range.

Positions: 500 shares @ about $54. IV is 170% for April, so good luck if you buy options on this, you'll need it.

2025-04-02 07:39:20,"NVDA and ""Liberation Day""",nonner101,20,"NVDA and Tariff Day

This thesis serves not only as analysis of NVDA and the semiconductor sector, but is a prediction for tomorrow - ""liberation day"".  

NVDA has a wide moat due to its CUDA software, and essentially holds a monopoly on parallel processing. Not only is this a focus of massive Mag 7 AI CAPEX, but it has an ever increasing amount of use cases due to developments in autonomous driving, IOT, robotics, healthcare, and more. While DeepSeek and tariff concerns have driven shares down recently, the company has an exceptional balance sheet and a 0.92 estimated EPS for its upcoming call.  

The current administration has clearly outlined its intention to be competitive in artificial intelligence, announcing in January Project Stargate, which aims to build out massive amounts of data centers in the United States with investment in AI deemed a strategic imperative.  

A close partner of NVDA, TSMC is the clear leader in semiconductor foundries due to its cutting edge nodes, which are protected by high barrier to entry and clear lack of viable domestic competition. Just yesterday, Commerce Secretary Lutnick stated to Bloomberg that TSMC's recent commitment to investing over $100 billion in the United States exemplified the actions this administration is seeking before distributing CHIPS Act grants. This investment was announced during TSMC CEO Wei's visit to the White House, with Mandango praising him as one of the most respected people in business, claiming a policy victory as Wei's actions reflected an intention to avoid tariffs through negotiation.  

Mandango is using tariffs as a form of economic brinkmanship, in an attempt to force companies to the negotiation table where they will capitulate and strike deals favorable to the United States. But with global supply chains being necessary for the semiconductor industry to function, the administration's stated goals of AI competitiveness, and the need for computation seeming insatiable, Mandango will carve out space in policy that is favorable for the sector. While the market as a whole may still see volatility in response to these policy changes, NVDA and the like will be an exception.  

TL;DR - Supporting domestic semiconductor design is critically important to the current administration's stated goals and sentiment around negative tariff impact is overblown.

I didn't get to post my DD with my YOLO because I failed a ban bet. Also I forgot to put it in the post.

Last week’s gold event: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab\_channel=Robinhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab_channel=Robinhood)

TLDR: IMO Robinhood is the best stock on the market right now with a great business model and the best team and has the most upside potential, even during a market downturn.

They had 1.5 million gold subscribers at $5/month last year. Now MORE THAN DOUBLED TO 3.2 MILLION.

Robinhood has the potential to become the next trillion-dollar company. Everyone is always looking for the next stock that will have NVDA or TSLA-like growth and I have good reason to believe that Robinhood is the one. Literally a 30-bagger since they’re at $37 billion, which is NOTHING. For example, about $1 trillion flew out of Nvidia in like a month and Robinhood only needs around $55 billion more to reach $100/share. They actually have a good business model leading the great leap forward in transforming finance with a CEO that is already mainstream. Man is on CNBC last week: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision)

They are going to smash earnings again IMO. Been taking money hand over fist. They already smashed earnings last quarter.

I’d say that inclusion into the S&P 500 is on the horizon. They just missed it last quarter but I see no reason why they can’t be in this quarter with a lot of stocks tanking. And we all know what happened when TSLA was put into the S&P 500 with a similarly well-known CEO known as the Elongated Muskrat. ROCKET EMOJI.

Robinhood is overhauling everything with their services, including the use of AI. That’s right. The AI buzzword. They cap their fees at $250/year for investment advisor systems.

Cash delivery? Bruh I’m never going to an ATM again: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

They have 12 partner banks so FDIC insurance is $2.5 million with them instead of $250,000: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/)

Robinhood is now VENMO/Apple Pay. You can send money to people instantly: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

Robinhood makes money on everything. Options, crypto, and now even straight-up gambling with prediction markets. Even in a terrible market they still make money on fees and subscriptions.

I don't really care about any litigation involving prediction markets and I don't think anyone else does either. Gambling always wins.

Cathie Wood bought like $25 million recently (Now holds 5% of ARKK’s holdings, TSLA is 11% for reference) and it was given a price target of $105 last week: [https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578)

IRA contribution and 401k transfer match is literally a money magnet.

People will live their entire financial lives through Robinhood. They have high-yield interest rates on uninvested cash and have a debit card. Kind of like how people use WeChat for everything.

They also have a credit card with 3% cash back on EVERYTHING (best on the market from what I’ve seen) = more money.

Great Wealth Transfer putting trillions of dollars in Millennials and Gen Z hands, going straight to RH for gambling, and especially on this sub.

Robinhood is honestly like a 7x leveraged SPY imo. Every time SPY is up 1% Robinhood is up 7%, and vice versa with the same chart pattern. SPY really only needs to go to 570 for HOOD to go to $50 from $42. $50 by the end of the week bc we will get the clarity from the big dude tomorrow.

Easy to use platform.

I am also predicting we have a face-ripping rally on liberation day because no one gives a fuck about tariffs. This is all about selling the rumor and buying the news so we all have certainty. JPOW also speaks Friday so my boy is going to pump it up.

Probably some more stuff I missed but in this shit hole of a market this is the stock I choose.

2025-04-02 00:41:07,‘Twas the Night Before Tariffs,Tahmeed09,6602,"Since some of you enjoyed my prior post, ‘Twas the night before rate cuts. I wanted to share my latest and greatest version, ‘Twas the Night Before Tariffs.

-

’Twas the night before tariffs, and all through the Street,
The traders were anxious, all glued to their seats.
Their orders were placed with precision and care,
In hopes that the White House would choose to play fair.

The bulls clutched their charts, their bets running high,
While bears rubbed their hands, expecting a dive.
And I with my laptop, a coffee in tow,
Refreshed every headline, awaiting the blow.

When out on the tape there arose such a clatter,
I sprang to my screen to see what was the matter.
Away to my Bloomberg, I clicked with a flash,
Skimmed through the news, prepared for a crash.

The headlines declared in big, flashing red,
“Tariffs confirmed!”—my stomach felt dread.
Steel and aluminum, twenty-five strong,
With autos and tech not far along.

China, the EU, and Canada too,
All in the crosshairs—what else is new?
No deals, no breaks, no truce left in sight,
Just markets in turmoil and fear overnight.

Then what to my weary eyes should appear,
But Powell himself with a smirk ear to ear.
He lifted his mic and cleared out his throat,
Then gave us a speech with a familiar note.

“The economy’s strong, inflation runs high,
Rate cuts are coming, but don’t ask me why.
Tariffs may hit, but markets will fight,
Just buy the damn dip and you’ll be alright.”

And just like that, the futures turned green,
Traders rejoiced—it felt like a dream!
I sighed as I watched, for deep down I knew,
That Powell and tariffs were playing us too.

So I logged out my screen and turned off the light,
“Happy trading to all, and to all—hedge it right!”",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jpbpym/twas_the_night_before_tariffs/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jpbpym/twas_the_night_before_tariffs/

	•	Liquidity hunting: big players move markets to trigger stops and collect liquidity.

	•	Retail timing: many of us follow similar signals, leading to predictable crowd behavior.

	•	Noise: markets are noisy, and random reversals will sometimes feel personal.

I get all of that. But I can’t help wondering: is there more to it?

	•	AI market counterparty: could algorithms have become so good that they are practically reading our individual orders in real time?

The number of vacancies fell slightly from a revised 7.8 million in January and from a 8.4 million a year earlier. Openings have come down more or less steadily since peaking at 12.2 million in March 2022 when the economy was still roaring back from COVID-19 lockdowns.

The American job market has proven surprisingly durable. But it has clearly lost momentum from the frantic hiring days of 2021-2023. And the outlook for hiring is cloudy as President Donald Trump pursues trade wars, purges the federal workforce and promises to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally.

On Friday, the Labor Department issues the jobs report for March. According to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet, it is expected to show that employers added 125,000 jobs last month, down from 151,000 in February and an average 168,000 a month in 2024.

2025-04-01 13:14:54,"Roblox announces new ad format, Google partnership to boost advertising business",callsonreddit,90,"(Reuters) - Roblox on Tuesday launched a new format of video advertising on its gaming platform and announced a partnership with Google to help boost the growth of its nascent ad business.

Gamers can choose to watch video advertisement, up to 30 seconds long, in exchange for boosts, lifelines or resources in a particular game through rewarded videos.

In the coming weeks, brands and agencies will be able to purchase this new form of marketing either directly or through Google's ad platform, making Roblox's offerings more widely available to a larger set of advertisers.

With Roblox's main videogame platform seeing strong engagement and monetization, the company has been looking to expand its overall business with advertising to take advantage of its large Gen Z user base.

Roblox had 85.3 million Daily Active Users on its platform as of its quarter ended December 31, with the majority these users being above the age of 13.

""Because gamers are so entrenched in the experience itself, traditional ad formats haven't always been the right choice for app publishers, because they don't want to pull their audiences out of those games,"" Scott Sheffer, vice president of sellside monetization at Google said in a roundtable briefing.

Amid stiff competition in the gaming industry, the advertising business has allowed Roblox to diversify revenue streams and position itself as an attractive option for marketers in search of a large audience.

Reuters reported last year the company hired former Roku executive Louqman Parampath to aid its advertising business.

Roblox has also partnered with data measurement firms such as Cint, DoubleVerify and Nielsen to help brands track the performance of their campaigns.

Over the coming months, other ad formats such as billboards will come to Google Ad Manager, the company said.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roblox-announces-ad-format-google-130434423.html,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jovaos/roblox_announces_new_ad_format_google_partnership/

Started off March on the wrong foot hoping to scalp a quick profit on 2X leveraged AVGO in the morning…eventually was all in and 🥭 announced that tariffs were not negotiable so I closed out. Went heavy trying to short NVDA with 2X leverage the next day but my timing was off, had I waited an hour or so, would’ve easily made $10k vs going on a roller coaster for a week and barely making profit. Then made some decent money on TSLQ that day TSLA fell more than 10%. Was frustrated that I had chickened out and sold within minutes because it’s an unpredictable meme stock so the next day I went back in…and got my shit pushed in. Tried it again one more time and similar result. At this point realized I gotta stop using leverage and figured we were due for a bounce so I started steadily buying shares of NBIS last week. Absolute worst move I could’ve made lol. Cut my losses yesterday. 

What really hurts is if I had just held most of these positions for 2 or more weeks, I’d have done way less damage to my portfolio. On the plus side, I don’t owe the IRS any money this quarter!

2025-04-01 02:40:23,Tariffs on Tech,2ndSifter,123,"***TLDR;*** *Analysts have emphasized the impacts of tariffs on commodities, autos, and tangible goods. However, the escalation of this tariff trade war will most significantly impact digital goods.*

***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  


On April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for ""rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America"". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/azbupva7p4se1.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=38847b3d9ae4e0c455639abd44c036e1ec923be9

  
***THE POINT:***

  
In 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called ""electronic transmissions"" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the ""internet"".**

  
This ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  
This moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:



[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)

In the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.

  
This framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to ""strike back"":***  


[Framework for digital trade under tariffs](https://preview.redd.it/8ty1db2sp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14880088e780e48b6796d64f5295d40e572fd0c)

***THE PROBLEM:***

Nearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. ""services"" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). 

The problem, then, is derived from the following:

[\>50&#37; of the revenue of the S&P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)

NVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.

***The Endgame:*** 

The tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **->** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **->** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **->** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \~50% of all U.S. spending

2025-04-01 00:22:00,Fed’s Williams says rates to remain steady for 'some time' amid Trump tariff uncertainty,callsonreddit,712,"New York Federal Reserve president John Williams told Yahoo Finance he expects the central bank to keep rates unchanged for ""some time"" as [policymakers watch](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-has-a-new-favorite-word-uncertainty-080031361.html) how new tariffs from President Trump affect the economy.

The tariffs, he added in an interview Monday, could produce ""more prolonged effects"" on inflation and he warned that it could take a few years to figure that all out.

""It is still early days to be able to come to a concrete conclusion around this,"" Williams said, noting that the central bank will be watching for ""indirect effects"" from new duties that “might not be fully felt for a couple of years.""

“Yes, we will see tariffs affect prices and then we will just have to keep watching how do those cascade into prices downstream to other goods in the economy,” he added, saying the Fed needs to “really have an open mind about how long these last in terms of their effects on inflation and the economy.”

The new comments from one of the Fed’s most influential policymakers come as central bankers wrestle with [the many uncertainties](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-has-a-new-favorite-word-uncertainty-080031361.html) ahead as the president rolls out his new trade policies. The next step comes Wednesday as the president is expected to unveil a set of new tariffs on many other countries.

The question for the Fed is whether any price increases caused by inflation will pass quickly or linger.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that his ""base case"" is that any extra inflation from Trump's slate of tariffs will be ""transitory.""

But [some of his colleagues worry the effects could be more persistent](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-has-a-new-favorite-word-uncertainty-080031361.html), adding to the uncertainties ahead for the central bank.

The Fed's goal is to get inflation down to its 2% target, but a key measure released last Friday remains well above that marker. The ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.8% year over year.

Inflation now stands at the level the Fed predicted it would be at year's end — and that's before some of Trump's most aggressive tariff plans kick in.

The worry among some economists and market watchers is that inflation could rise and economic growth could slow, creating a so-called stagflation environment that was last seen in the 1970s.

Williams said he sees no signs of stagflation ""now,"" citing an unemployment rate of 4.1% and headline inflation around 2.5%.

He also pledged, ""We will not let high inflation take root like it did in the 70s and 80s.""

At the same time, though, “there is definitely a risk of inflation being higher than what’s in the forecast.”

The economy, he said, is ""in a very good place,"" but he acknowledged a “lot of uncertainty” about how it will evolve this year.

He also noted that uncertainty has shifted somewhat more toward concerns about slowing economic growth, but he says also there is a greater risk of rising inflation.

“My own view is economy will continue to grow but slower than it did last year.”

Williams kept coming back to the level of uncertainty, using that word a total of nine times.

""There's a lot of uncertainty about how the economy will evolve and a lot of uncertainty about all the policy actions. We'll see about that, but also how the US economy, and importantly, the global economy, respond to these developments.""

Thus, for ""some time"" he expects the Fed to keep its rates unchanged as it did at its last meeting earlier this month.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-williams-says-rates-to-remain-steady-for-some-time-amid-trump-tariff-uncertainty-210346896.html,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1joiknz/feds_williams_says_rates_to_remain_steady_for/

2025-03-31 19:24:42,What forecasted news would realistically turn the market around this year? Seriously,TheLelouchLamperouge,373,"Just my opinion, and I hope I’m wrong when I say I really don’t see anything that’s bullish for this year. Between the job market data that may be poor in the near future, the increased cost of goods due to tariffs, and possibly less overall foreign investment also due to tariffs/the trade war, it’s looking pretty bleak. 

For those who disagree, what exactly are you banking on to pump the market?

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/live-blog/rcna198780

Gold data:

https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/gold

When I say bleak, I don’t necessarily mean full blown recession. Although I’m not sure of what recession catalyst couldn’t be shunted by fractional reserve banking and bailouts, I see a rather poor performance at least for the rest of this year, as well as next year. 

I can think of one item, and only one item that would have actual weight in improving business productivity, possibly at the cost of jobs however. Some of you probably already had this buzzword typed up a: AI

Before those of you who say AI is bs, “just a chatbot” ect, it’s coming, regardless of what you think. AI stocks like NVDA (yes by proxy), META, etc, are not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about low level, fresh out of college paper pushing jobs, even up to project management to an extent. AI will effectively optimize industries that require data organization, data entry, drafting up timelines, reports, repetitive remedial tasks etc. Do not confuse this with “ITS GONNA TAKE ALL OF YOUR JOBS” it’s going to improve the effectiveness of those who utilize it first in their respective industries. The HR industry could benefit from it to an extent, but only with intense moderation at first. This eventually will transform the type of jobs available, one of which will be something of the sort of AI moderators. AI are not capable of being autonomous by any means at this point of time but can be used to expedite many processes. But it’s not happening yet, I haven’t heard any news of any large firm implementing a trained model thats able to increase productivity by some wild metric.

2025-03-31 14:27:25,How to trade this market,stocker0504,98,"
I just want to show that you can play the market both ways. During bull market I buy and hold and selling options. Bear market I trade trends. I was up over
50% in 2022.

I use trend lines as my main indicator for short and long term trends. I can show some insight in later posts.

My results: 3 year return 150%+ compared to SPY 26%
YTD return positive.

Last Friday I bought 100x QQQ puts(see my previous post). I took 80% profit by end of day. This morning I close them all since we are oversold for the short term. Bought 4k shares of TQQQ this morning. I will probably close them out if we get a decent short term rally, or if we stay flat for a few days and RSI cools off even if I lose on TQQQ.

NFA and I don't sell anything. Don't need to. So don't pm me.

As of writing my TQQQ are down slightly.

The goal of this: I think TTWO has potential to be a strong blueprint to building out a whole option scalp plan.. but obviously it’d take a maximum autist crowd source effort

Elon’s xAI reportedly picked both $SMCI and $DELL for its AI infrastructure. Now we’re hearing Apple is doing the same this year.

So here’s my question:
Why are they always bundling SMCI and DELL together?
If SMCI is the market leader in liquid cooling and has the bleeding-edge tech for AI servers, why not just go all-in on them?

Is this a case of:
	•	Dell having better enterprise logistics or support?
	•	Some kind of scale balancing? (SMCI = high-performance racks, Dell = standardization?)
	•	Risk mitigation by not going full SMCI?
	•	Or is there something SMCI doesn’t do well that Dell covers?

Just feels weird that the “AI Arms Race” giants are choosing both like it’s a power combo.
Any insights? Anyone with industry knowledge want to weigh in?

Not financial advice, but I’m trying to figure out how to play this.

Not only is this bad from a micro perspective for each of these individuals, but if enough people have made similar mistakes, US tax receipts are going to be much less than anticipated.

Just in case any of you regards who YOLO'd your life savings into Nikola back in 2020 thought you were getting some of your money back...nope.

Notable quote from the big man himself:

>“I am free. The prosecutors can no longer hurt me,” he said. “They can’t destroy my family, they can’t rip everything away from me, they can’t ruin my life.”

So nice that Trev can no longer have his life ruined. Too fucking bad for the hundreds, if not thousands of shareholders who he scammed with his truck-rolling-down-the-hill fiasco.

2025-03-28 15:12:54,Mineral production discussion,TheLelouchLamperouge,18,"Domestic mineral production plays?

(Yes Ik GGN is global, just read the post)

https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/

For those who don’t like to click links, or read long winded explanations: 

Mango signed an EO to effectively give out permits to kickstart domestic mineral production in the US.


Longer winded discussion:

Here’s the hook, any of the NVDA regards who absolutely love AI and chips and gaming ect, by proxy love minerals. 

Minerals are paramount to the technology sector in pretty much every corner of the field. From military industrial, to domestic infrastructure,  computer chips, vehicles, batteries, other electrical components, all dependent on minerals. 


For everyone else who’s interested, the short term play(s) will be now, and on Monday. The executive order signed last week on Thursday 3/20/25 states 10 days after the date of the order, a list will be composed of current domestic mineral “producers” with operations to be expedited in any permits required to continue operations/ increase or start new operations. 

Personally, my watchlist is comprised mostly of pennystocks due to the nature of the current industry. What I mean by this is generally speaking we as a country (USA) have outsourced much of the industrialization of the modern world to other countries with cheaper exports. Yes there are domestic producers that are larger, I’m somewhat weary of the performance of these in the longer term. 

To preface, I currently hold no positions as of yet, however last Friday 2/21/25 to last Monday 2/24/25 I scalped a pennystock (that I’m not allowed to name) based on the EO news.

The only domestic non pennystock on my list is BHP, an elderly company that has the infrastructure to produce already. I’m not holding currently due to lacker performance as well as looking to not make a play until the list comes out on Sunday. The other play I’ve made is GGN which isn’t domestic, but still a hedge as tariffs could generally increase the price of gold anyways as it already has for copper. And GGN pays a sweet dividend. 

If anyone is interested in the mining watchlist I’ll be playing, just look up domestic lithium, the pebble property (largest known copper deposit), or look up battery grade graphite. These are all separate operations fyi. 

I’ve done DD but all of my favorite picks are literally pennystocks for the short term. And yet again, asides from BHP, pennystocks dependent on the executive order handing out permits to start production. 

Anyone who has some insight + non pennystock tickers feel free to comment. Thanks

Will it go back up? I can't tell you. But this is a great price/opportunity for regards who are looking for a ticker to regard at and who are not paying attention or doing their DD.

I currently have a little under half my portfolio dumped into it (the rest is mostly sitting in cash) and will be buying out as much as I can, bit by bit, if it continues dropping.

Note - That average cost isn't accurate (not that that matters), that's what it was this morning before I bought the dip... My robinhood app on the desktop and phone aren't updating my average cost and i'm not sure why. I've bought \~half of these shares in the last hour and it hasn't moved...

2025-03-28 13:11:09,Thinking about a different kind of “pet insurance” - investing in Trupanion (TRUP) instead of buying a policy. Curious for feedback.,ThomasCleopatraCarl,0,"So this might sound ridiculous — I’ve been thinking about a slightly off the beaten path investing idea and wanted to get some feedback.

I’ve got two pets, and we don’t currently have pet insurance for them. I’ve done a bit of research on Trupanion (TRUP), and while I’m still on the fence about their policies (they seem to up your rate regularly but that feels like it happens across the pet insurance industry annually)… I was wondering about a different approach: what if I just bought a share of Trupanion stock every month instead of paying for a policy?

Right now, their stock is trading around $38, which is not close to what a typical monthly premium might cost. My thinking is that if my pets stay healthy, I’m building equity in a company that stands to benefit from more people using pet insurance (which I genuinely feel will happen over time) — kind of like a self-funded safety net that grows with the industry. Worst case, I can sell the shares if I ever do face a big vet bill.

Curious if anyone else has thought this way for like a different service or product or has any perspective on this idea — either as an investing strategy or should I just get a legit pet insurance. Is this dumb as hell? A waste of time? Somewhere in between?

# 



**TLDR: This is an extremely high-risk play. I'm taking a degenerate, short-term bullish position on $QUBT and long-term short position on quantum computing stocks as a whole, with the anticipation of extremely volatile $QUBT price action soon.** 

Current Positions:

\- Short: mostly IONQ, with almost entirely put debit spreads

\- Degenerate short-term OTM calls: QUBT, rolling weekly



# Quantum Companies are Bad

I have returned after a couple years away to bring good tidings and some DD about a play I believe will have some extreme volatility in the coming two weeks. Over the past six or so months, quantum computing stocks have had a wild ride. Up 1200% down, [pimp slapped hard](https://qz.com/quantum-computing-stocks-nvidia-ceo-rigetti-dwave-ionq-1851771538), recovered some and currently teetering towards inevitable doom.

  
That's right. They are all doomed. Overvalued, overhyped and **running out of steam**. You don't need me to tell you that these companies are trash. Many big names have been trashing the industry, [Martin Shkreli](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1895480382629556486) and [Kerrisdale Capital](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/investments/ionq/) being two of the most notable.

# Why Do I Care about QUBT

While all of the quantum companies have little to show for their insane valuations, QUBT is a real gem. Despite missing last quarter's disappointing earnings of -$0.47/share (est. -$0.05) they maintain a respectable market cap of \~$1.1B while having nothing to sell. 



***IF YOU READ ANYTHING ON THIS POST, READ THIS PARAGRAPH.*** Per the [S-8 filed 3/21/2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000101376225001115/ea0235205-s8_quantum.htm), insiders for $QUBT were recently approved to sell their shares. **Only two insiders stated immediate intent to sell stock by this coming Monday (3/31/2025).** As of 3/27/2025 only one insider has sold, with the Chairman of the Board[ Yuping Huang selling 200,000 out of his 27-million currently owned shares two days ago](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000196858225000237/xsl144X01/primary_doc.xml). The other insider expressing intent is a director who only owns 207,000 shares. **Assuming the Chairman is done selling, insider dilution shouldn't be a near-term worry, but is always possible.** Currently, [multiple firms are suing the shit](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8f5ad3653710c57c&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1129US1129&sxsrf=AHTn8zpwApo4bS8d-5dXiXB8EM1N_8SZgg:1743160180622&q=qubt+lawsuit&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpmDtIGL1r84kuKz6yAcD_igefx-eKq1gCPHF3zhthFoneNn6lL83lY3KLybUMxCNDhMUtbCQQO9t_eGxoOP_s3rR9imLItfH1uBSfE1eodVtu3j9NNltXXuqTU0fP37mjBusR7Pi0GSAtMbdArRUTLOsC4dN4POVlfGKFb_2PiWfOtFnP-rmmP8j0Odsy8bbuGSebXg&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwi74uja0ayMAxUCCnkGHfJkOOIQ0pQJegQIIRAB&biw=1718&bih=1304&dpr=1) out of this company. Any insider selling this close to the unlock would just accelerate the dumpster fire. 

As you can imagine, QUBT is being beaten down to oblivion. However, after scratching the surface it becomes apparent that there is ever mounting stress on QUBT short sellers. Below, I have a little spreadsheet w/ some relevant short data and some recent options flows depicting deep ITM call buying, which can be highly indicative of low liquidity.

>Barclays said on Thursday it favors fixed income investments over equities for the first time in ""several quarters"" and warned global economic growth was at risk due to U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating tariff policies.Despite hurdles such as rising prices and poor fiscal outlooks in Western economies, the risk to fixed income assets was less than to equities, Barclays analysts said in a note.



>We have been overweight global equities over fixed income for several quarters, even as valuations became stretched. But now, the policy risks strike us as tilted largely to the downside

My take on the news is pretty simple: Banks took way to long to get honest with their customers about how bad it would come. And american institutions probably won´t even yet, just out of fear of reprisals. Other - less kindly mannered people - may claim it is, because they want to suck up every possible dime out there, before the music stops. Basically the fact that any banks are lighting the beacons of Gondor should be shocking enough to let everybody pause.

2025-03-28 03:19:27,"I believe that Coreweave is already underwater, and their IPO is an exit strategy for existing shareholders:",2ndSifter,1300,"Coreweave is set to launch its IPO tomorrow at $40 per share. Its NVDIA backing sounds promising, but balance sheet constraints and shady collateral backing for massive loans can’t be brushed off.

Coreweave managed to skyrocket into the headlines over the past couple of years after solidifying its position as a significant AI player. This parabolic rise was, in part, thanks to a $2.3b loan collateralized by NVDIA GPUs. However, a simple google search of the collateral posted for this loan, Nvidia H100 tensor core gpu, will likely lead you to the same conclusion illustrated below.

When Coreweave secured an initial $2.3b in cash from investors, they posted NVDA chips as collateral. The rapid cash injection buoyed them onto the AI scene relatively quickly. However, that form of collateral has proven itself to be less than fundamentally sound over the past couple of years.
*Source: (https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/)*

When Coreweave posted the NVDA chips as collateral in 2023, the value was marked-to-market at ~$47,000/processor. That same processor is now worth 30% less. For context - their total loan value came in at a whopping $7.6 billion near the end of 2024. Simply put: technology is advancing quickly, and the collateral is rapidly degrading in value. Additionally, the cost to rent these GPUs is falling - why own the asset when you can rent it for 1/100th the price?

In December of 2024, Coreweave breached terms of their $7.6b loan through various ""unspecified"" actions and ""accidents"". However, their primary lender Blackstone was generous enough to waive these shortcomings and amend their loan.
*Source: (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798dex1015.htm)*

Wildly enough, the cause of the near technical default was found to be due to an overstatement of collateral - Coreweave was alleged to not have tangibly held as many GPUs as they reported. The ""administrative accident"" was Coreweave attempting to sure-up it's reserves as to avoid defaulting on it's obligations.

That same company, ""backed"" by NVDA, will now IPO tomorrow. At $40 per share, the implied value is $19b. As it stands today, that $7.6b loan (that they nearly defaulted on 3 months ago) is nearly 1/2 of their entire market cap.

Just keep that in mind before smashing that buy button tomorrow after the buffer period.

The tariff rate/flat import tax for Canada and Mexico is 25%. ANYTHING coming from these two will have a import duty charge of +25%.

i couldnt find 2024 figures but gold imports in 2023:

128.40 Tonnes from Canada ($6.84B) and 36.8 tonnes from Mexico ($1.18B)

That's 165.2 tonnes imported from these two countries and the total US consumption for 2024 was 200 tonnes.

Per CNBC, More than 600 tons, or almost 20 million ounces of gold, has been transported into vaults in New York City since December last year. If retail, commercial and investment demand keeps up and the vaults start to run dry for delivery i think we see a huge spike in gold as demand outruns supply. Same situation with silver.

As gold goes higher, who is the single largest gold holder in the world? The USA. Who has a big debt problem? The USA. I don't think a gold standard will ever come back but just floating the idea will generate alot of interest.

Europe

	•	Citroën (France, Spain, Slovakia)

	•	Fiat (Italy, Poland, Serbia, Turkey)
	•	Alfa Romeo (Italy)
	•	Maserati (Italy)
	•	Jeep (Italy - some models like the Avenger)

South America
	•	Fiat (Brazil, Argentina)
	•	Jeep (Brazil - Renegade, Compass, Commander)
	•	Peugeot & Citroën (Argentina, Brazil)

Asia
	•	Jeep (India, China - localized models)
	•	Peugeot (China, Malaysia)
	•	Citroën (China, India)
	•	Dongfeng-Peugeot-Citroën (China, under joint venture)

Stellantis has a strong presence in Europe due to its legacy brands (Fiat, Peugeot, Citroën, Opel) and also maintains production in emerging markets like Brazil and China.”

If they are already making Fiat and Jeep in Brazil(hint this is to avoid tariffs in Brazil) what’s to say they do not do the same in the US. I think of all of the car companies going through these tariffs and uncertainty stelantis are positioned well location wise, financially, debt wise and value wise.
-cash on hand is $34 billion
-assets $207b
-total debt $37b(has increased due to England location issues)
-market cap $44b(can almost buy the whole company outright with their cash on hand )
-sitting at a 6.18 P/E
-paying 13% dividend(24) has lowered to about 6% this year, I consider this a smart move (why give out larger dividends now vs taking on larger debt at interest if needed in future) this is a smarter use from managment with market uncertainty’s.

Alright degenerates, I did some real homework. Went back to 1928 and looked at every time the S&P 500 hit a fresh all-time high, then dropped 10% or more — a classic “correction.” Here's the TL;DR:

If SPX hits an ATH and then corrects -10%, but then bounces back up above that correction level, it always drops back down to 91% of the ATH (aka a -9% drawdown from the top) within 60 trading days.  
Doesn't matter how good the rebound looks. Doesn’t matter how hard Greenspan/Bernanke/Yellen/JPow flexes. It’s like gravity.

There is one recent exception in 1997 though. I can't explain that away so take this however you like.

So i was digging up, looking for the next under the radar big movers and i think I've got something.

VITESSE ENERGY, a non-operating gas and oil company. 

let me explain, recently they posted earning wich missed big time due to their recent acquisition of Lucero energy. At the same they issued their quartermy dividend and the whole market was panik red.

You get the point, they were ""unrightfully"" oversold.

So my theory is that it can, in a matters of month rebound to a price around 26-27 due to these :

1- oversold yet fundamentals are good

2- in case of uncertain and bearish market investor tend to like energy stock and you can see a rise in volume

3- they focus on domestic production wich can be boosted by the tax war, focus on april 2

4- 90% of reddit talk about Raw material or some goofy biotech with the 35th potential cure for cancer or whatever

5- insiders are stock pilling like crazy

2025-03-26 13:31:57,NVDA 110 and 120 5/16 cash secured puts (6th time writing NVDA puts),diddycorp,88,"NVDA is down 1.8% premarket at the time I am publishing this.

Over the last two days, I rolled 30 of 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps (cash secured puts) to NVDA 5/16 120 csps and received an additional $11k premium. Wrote another 30 NVDA 5/16 110 csps for $9k premium. Altogether 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps and 30 NVDA 5/16 120 csps for a total of $35k premium. I picked the expiration to be one week before earnings so the premiums are not inflated by earnings and I would like to have the option to make another earnings play if the price is around $120.

After factoring in premiums, the average cost to purchase is $105 and $115 respectively. I picked $110 and $120 because NVDA’s lower range is around $110 and upper range is around $140, so in the worst case (of my) scenario, I would be purchasing NVDA at the lower end of the range. If I’m wrong, then NVDA is a good stock to hold long term.

I don’t need to bore anyone to list all of the reasons NVDA is a buy including exploding need and revenue from data centers; just beginning to scratch surface on AI in automobiles/partnership with AI companies; growing domestic revenue (47% 63B revenue) that won’t be impacted by AI restrictions…

Worst case scenario, NVDA tanks below $110 and I am forced to buy 7,000 more shares. In that case I will just hold on to a stock that I am confident will double in 5 years. Best case scenario for me is if the price remains in the 129 range and I will get to write puts again (6th time) and continue to collect premiums.

2025-03-26 06:48:31,$AVXL - Alzheimer’s Drug that Actually Works - Pending EMA Approval,baroo88,290,"
1. Introduction to Blarcamesine

Blarcamesine, also known as ANAVEX®2-73, is an investigational oral therapy developed by Anavex Life Sciences. It functions as an agonist of the sigma-1 (SIGMAR1) receptor and muscarinic receptors, aiming to restore cellular homeostasis disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.

**Additional reading:** https://www.sotcanalytics.com/

2. Clinical Trial Insights

A pivotal Phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial evaluated blarcamesine’s efficacy in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients over 48 weeks. The results were promising:
	•	Cognitive Benefits: Blarcamesine significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks, indicating a notable preservation of cognitive function.  ￼
	•	Safety Profile: The therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no significant neuroimaging adverse events reported.  ￼
	•	SIGMAR1 Wild-Type Subgroup Analysis: In a prespecified analysis focusing on patients with the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant), blarcamesine exhibited an even greater clinical benefit. These patients experienced a 49.8% reduction in clinical progression at 48 weeks on the primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. **This represents over 70% of the patient population.** 

These results were published in a peer reviewed journal article over 50 doctors/researchers  representing 42 external organizations: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2274580724006083

3. Market Potential


The Alzheimer’s therapeutics market is poised for substantial growth:
	•	Current and Projected Market Size: Valued at approximately $4.05 billion in 2022, the market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.99%, reaching around $15.19 billion by 2030.
	•	Valuation of Alzheimer’s Drugs: An FDA-approved Alzheimer’s drug can carry a market value of approximately $43.4 billion. For instance, Biogen’s Aducanumab was valued at this figure upon approval. Similarly, drugs in Phase 3 trials, like Eli Lilly’s Donanemab, have been valued around $20.2 billion, with potential increases upon receiving Breakthrough Therapy Designation.

**AVXL inexplicably has a market cap under $1B with over 25% of the float short**. If they even sniff the valuations argued here, we’re looking at a triple digit share price. 

https://ipwatchdog.com/2021/10/26/assessing-much-alzheimers-drug-worth/id=139154/

4. Investment Considerations

Investors should monitor:
	•	Regulatory Milestones: Blarcamesine has received EMA filing acceptance for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, marking a significant step toward potential market approval. **A decision should be made by the end of 2025** 

	•    Upcoming conference on April 5th which Anavex is expected to reveal additional subgroup analysis of their trial. 

5. Conclusion

Blarcamesine represents a compelling candidate in the Alzheimer’s therapeutics sector. Its innovative mechanism of action, coupled with favorable clinical trial results, positions it as a potential frontrunner in addressing a significant unmet medical need. Given the substantial market valuations observed with similar drugs, blarcamesine’s successful development and approval could yield considerable financial returns.

I have consistently been buying $TSLA puts every time it pumps and made decent money but guys, this time it's different.

2025-03-25 15:19:38,Due Diligence $TTD Calls,unabayarde,42,"
**Due Diligence: TTD $70 Calls (07/18) – 100 Contracts at $4.80**  
**Ticker:** The Trade Desk (**TTD**)  
**Position:** **100x $70 Calls** (July 18, 2024)  
**Entry Price:** **$4.80** ($48,000 total risk)  
**Current Stock Price:** **~$65.50** | **Option Price:** **$4.85** ($48,500 position value)  
**Thesis:** Betting on a swift $70+ breakout.  

 **1. Why I’m Playing This**  
- **Earnings Momentum:** TTD surged **20%+ post-Q1** (May 2024) on ad-tech strength.  
- **Technical Setup:** Broke $65 resistance; next stop **$70-75** (pre-ATH zone).  
- **Catalyst Potential:** Summer streaming demand (Olympics, Netflix ads, etc.).  


 **2. Position Math**  
- **Breakeven:** **$74.80** ($70 strike + $4.80 premium).  
- **Profit Potential:**  
  - At **$70**: Calls worth ~$3.00 (-37.5%, but salvageable).  
  - At **$75**: Calls worth ~$5.20 (+8% + intrinsic value).  
  - At **$80**: Calls worth ~$10.20 (+112%).  
- **Max Risk:** **$48,000** (if TTD ≤ $70 by July 19).  


**3. Why 100 Contracts?**  
- **High Conviction:** Expecting volatility squeeze toward $70+.  
- **Liquidity Managed:** Using limit orders to avoid slippage (bid-ask: $4.75/$4.85).  
- **Exit Plan:** Scale out at $6.00 (25% gain), $8.00 (67% gain), etc.  


 **4. Risks I’m Watching**  
⚠️ **Theta Decay:** Losing ~$1.00/week in July (accelerates fast).  
⚠️ **Low Volume:** Open Interest = [X] – may need to exit early.  
⚠️ **Macro Risks:** Weak ad spend data or market pullback.  


**5. Trade Management**  
✅ **Added Stop Loss:** Auto-sell 50% if TTD < $63.  
🎯 **Profit Targets:**  
- **25% at $6.00** (sell 25 contracts).  
- **50% at $7.50** (sell 50 contracts).  
- **Let runners ride** if $75+ breakout.  
🔄 **Hedge:** Considering $75 puts if market turns.  


 **6. Why Post This Now?**  
- **Accountability:** Putting my money where my mouth is.  
- **Discussion:** Are others playing TTD? Better ideas?  
- **Transparency:** No pump—just sharing my thesis.  

---  

**Final Thoughts**  
**Bull Case:** TTD’s CTV growth justifies $75+.  
**Bear Case:** $4.80 premium is steep—needs a strong move.  
**My Bet:** Worth the risk for a **10-20%+ move in 4 weeks**.  

**What’s Your Take?**  
- *""Would you hold or hedge this position?""*  
- *""Is $70 realistic by July?""*  
- *""Any red flags I missed?""*  


**Let’s debate!** 🚀  ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjlu3t,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jjlu3t/due_diligence_ttd_calls/

2025-03-25 03:02:52,Thoughts on Quantum Computing - from a Physicist,fzy325,1071,"*New post, now with screenshot.*

My background: PhD student in Physics, working on quantum information on the theory side. I do know many friends that work on the experimental side, though.

As much as I appreciate the interest in my field over the last year or so, I personally think it's best to keep expectations realistic. Especially with some DD posts I have seen posting incomplete information, and even blatantly false statements (in Physics). I want to clear those up and some personal thoughts on some quantum computing startups.

**Quantum communication doesn't allow for faster-than-light propagation of information**

I have seen a DD post that says IonQ achieved faster than light communication via networked entanglement of particles. VERY common misconception about entanglement. Affecting one particle in a pair of entangled particles does not affect the other, it will just break the entanglement. It is proven to be impossible via the [no-communication theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem).

**Breaking Cryptography, more like breaking your portfolio as you baghold for 10-20 years**

Yes, Shor's algorithm is real. No, it won't be possible to break encryption until we get a quantum computer with at least 2000 qubits. The most optimal implementations  of Shor's algorithm requires around 2n qubits to factor an n-bit number.

As an example for RSA-1024, you'll need more than 2000 LOGICAL qubits. Factoring in error correction, which requires multiple PHYSICAL qubits to represent one single logical qubit, you'll most likely need upwards of 100k physical qubits before we can actually break real-world encryption. I personally see that taking at least 20 years, but some more optimistic estimates place it at 10 years.

**IonQ**

There's many DD touting IonQ's lower error rates, longer lifetimes, and all-to-all connectivity. While all of these are true, they often forget to mention one drawback: the gate speeds.

It takes around a thousand times longer to execute an operation on trapped ion platforms compared to superconducting platforms (which Google, IBM uses). While finance/techbros that have never touched a quantum mechanics textbook will point to the fact that the lifetime of the qubit is at most on the order of 100 seconds, and think that quantum algorithms won't require more than that time anyways, so this shouldn't be an issue.

However, keep in mind that the algorithms that are most likely to see real-world use are optimization algorithms like VQE and QAOA. These algorithms need to repeat the quantum circuit many, many times as they gradually change the parameters in the circuit to find the optimal set of solutions.

Furthermore, if your circuit output is some continuous variable that's encoded into the probability of measuring one of the states, then you need to repeat the circuit upwards of thousands of time to get a good estimate of that probability.

As a conservative estimate for a simple optimization algorithm, let's say that you need 1000 repetitions of the circuit, each one taking 1000 repetitions to get the output, and each run of the circuit takes 1 second on a trapped ion computer. That takes 11 and a half days on a trapped ion computer, as compared to 17 minutes on a superconducting one. If we use a pay-by-the-minute model in the future for quantum computers, then IonQ likely has to charge less per minute, since you need more time to run an algorithm on their platform. Sure, they can charge a premium for the lower error rates, but if they charge the same amount per minute as superconducting platforms, then customers are likely to simplify the algorithm they want to run (to be more tolerant of errors) to get a solution at a thousandth of the price.

**Rigetti**

Honestly, looking at their spec sheets for their platforms, and comparing it to Google's and IBM's, I don't see them pulling ahead at any point. Their board also literally kicked out the original founder for (allegedly) being a prick in general.

**QUBT**

Literally never seen any substantial work from them.

**Disclaimer**

This is not financial advice. I've literally got my portfolio tied up in RKLB and LUNR because I don't know anything about space outside of Kerbal Space Program. I don't invest in quantum because I know quantum. I invest in space because I don't know space.

this is all the money i have after working full time in highschool at wendy's (literally) and all four years of college as a lab tech saving and investing as much as possible. I believe I’ll make a of minimum 2x off this investment.

valaris (val) is the largest offshore drilling contractor by fleet size, operating 53 rigs, including 18 floaters (13 drillships and 5 semisubmersibles) and 35 jackups. the company provides contract drilling services to major oil companies such as exxonmobil, chevron, bp, shell, petrobras, and equinor. following a downturn in the offshore drilling industry and a 2020 bankruptcy restructuring, valaris emerged with no long-term debt, a modernized fleet, and an improving financial position, allowing it to capitalize on the offshore drilling recovery.

offshore drilling fundamentals are improving as the supply of rigs has tightened significantly. a decade ago, the global offshore fleet consisted of approximately 300 vessels, but that number has now dropped to around 150, with only 120-130 of them actively operational. meanwhile, demand for offshore drilling has rebounded, leading to a sharp increase in day rates, which are the prices oil companies pay to lease a drilling rig per day. since 2022, drillship day rates have doubled from around $250k per day to $500k per day. during the last cycle, they peaked at $800k per day, and current market conditions suggest they could reach $900k per day. offshore drilling has also become more cost-competitive, with breakeven prices of around $40 per barrel, compared to $60 per barrel for most u.s. shale projects.

valaris has one of the strongest financial positions in the industry. unlike competitors such as transocean, which is burdened with over $6.5 billion in debt, valaris currently operates with minimal net debt relative to industry peers, giving it a major advantage in capital allocation and flexibility. despite its strong position, the company remains deeply undervalued. with an enterprise value of approximately $5.1 billion compared to an estimated $30 billion replacement cost for its fleet, valaris is currently trading at just 16 cents on the dollar relative to its assets. management has been actively repurchasing shares, reducing the share count by around 5% since 2021, and the company maintains a buyback yield of approximately 5%, further enhancing shareholder value.

valuation metrics further support the investment case. based on projected fcf, valaris is trading at a p/fcf of about 10x for 2025 and 4x for 2026. ev/ebitda ratio stands at around 5x for 2025 and is expected to drop to 3x in 2026, whereas industry peers typically trade at 8-10x. net asset value analysis suggests a target enterprise value of around $27 billion, implying a potential 7x upside from current levels.

if drillship day rates continue their upward trajectory and approach $900k per day, applying a peak-cycle nav multiple of 1.5x would imply an enterprise value of approximately $27 billion, which translates to a share price of around $500, representing a 10x return from current levels. in a more conservative scenario where day rates stabilize between $600k and $700k per day, a 1.25x nav multiple would still yield an enterprise value of $18 billion to $22 billion, implying a share price in the range of $250 to $350, or a 5-7x return. even in a bearish case where day rates hold at $500k per day, applying a 1.0x nav multiple would still result in an enterprise value of $14 billion to $18 billion, meaning the stock could reach $150 to $200 per share, offering a 2-3x return from current levels.

there are risks to consider, such as oil price volatility, which could affect offshore drilling demand. however, offshore projects now have lower breakevens than shale, making them more resilient to price fluctuations. execution risk is another factor, as management must continue optimizing capital allocation and fleet utilization. additionally, the market may take time to recognize the disconnect between valaris’s asset value and its current share price.

despite these risks, valaris presents one of the most compelling deep-value opportunities in the market. it is trading well below its asset value while benefiting from rising day rates, improving financials, and aggressive share buybacks. in a conservative scenario, the stock has 2-3x upside, while in a more bullish offshore drilling cycle, it could rise 5-10x from current levels. with strong industry tailwinds and a clean balance sheet, valaris offers an asymmetric risk-reward opportunity that is rare in today’s market.

i believe offshore drilling is the best investment opportunity over the next couple years and im all in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jj8n0y/30k_yolo_on_val/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jj8n0y/30k_yolo_on_val/

# Addressing the Impact of the Semaglutide Shortage Ending

On February 21, 2025, the FDA declared the semaglutide shortage over. This was big news for Hims & Hers, as it came just days before their earnings call. While the timing was unexpected, it ultimately worked in HIMS’ favor, allowing management to adjust guidance and directly answer difficult questions on the call.

**What Was the Semaglutide Shortage, and Why Does It Matter?**

Pharmaceutical companies are incentivized through patents, which grants them exclusive rights to sell patented drugs and recoup the costs of research and development. For example, Novo Nordisk holds the patent for Ozempic (semaglutide) until 2031. However, if the drug is in high demand and the company is unable to meet supply, the FDA can declare a shortage. This allows generic compounded versions of the drug to be sold by other companies, even while under patent protection. This allows companies like HIMS to sell their own generic GLP-1 to help meet the demand of the drug during a supply shortage.

With Novo Nordisk now claiming they can meet demand; the FDA has removed semaglutide from the shortage list. As a result, companies like HIMS can no longer sell compounded generics commercially.

However, there’s a legal loophole:

* Semaglutide is commercially available in fixed doses (0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 1.7mg, and 2.4mg).
* If a specific prescribed dose is unavailable, it can still be compounded and sold.

Since HIMS specializes in personalization, many of its GLP-1 prescriptions are in personalized, custom dosages. HIMS has committed to continuing to provide these dosages where clinically necessary.

CEO Andrew Dudum has made it clear that while HIMS can no longer sell commercial dosages of GLP-1, that they will continue providing personalized prescriptions where clinically necessary.

On the earnings call, CFO Yemi Okupe emphasized this point: ***“What we see in general in our platform is, as Andrew mentioned, many of the folks that are coming to our platform have come and have had struggles with GLP-1s in the past. That was the genesis behind one of the reasons behind why we very quickly looked to roll out the personalized dosages as well.****""*

He also noted that “a majority of individuals on the platform today are utilizing personalized dosages versus the commercially available dosages.”

**Example of HIMS GLP-1 Onboarding Regimen:** Note the customized dosages.

# The Financial Impact of GLP-1

My prior estimate for GLP-1 Revenue as of Q3 2024 was 10-15% of total revenue. The company has now confirmed $225 million in GLP-1 revenue for 2024, approximately 15% of total FY24 revenue.

*Subscriber growth and revenue growth existed prior to GLP-1 announcements and offerings at HIMS.* HIMS has been a disruptive and rapidly growing company before introducing GLP-1 into the equation.

Of note: GLP-1 was primarily a revenue and subscriber driver in the short term with compressed margins due to initial investment costs. The company has made it clear that economies of scale take time for new product lines.

**Gross Margin Compression from 82% to 79.45% YoY.** Expected per HIMS due to GLP-1.

I believe that GLP-1 ‘hype’ certainly fueled much of the recent stock craze surrounding HIMS but it was not, and has not been, a core tenet of my thesis for the investment. HIMS is well-positioned to adapt, already planning to:

* Continue offering personalized GLP-1 dosages.
* Bring back commercial GLP-1 with any new shortage.
* Expand its weight loss portfolio, emphasizing its oral weight loss medications (already generating $100M+ in revenue within seven months of launch).
* Introduce liraglutide as an alternative weight loss treatment in 2025.

While there will be customers that leave HIMS, many customers who initially joined for GLP-1 are expected to transition to other offerings.

# Debunking the “No Moat” Argument

I disagree with the idea that HIMS lacks a competitive moat…

# Brand & Marketing Moat

While I have been aware of HIMS since IPO, it first caught my attention as an investment opportunity due to its standout marketing strategy. HIMS has executed on a marketing strategy that has created a strong, trusted brand. Simply put, HIMS makes Erectile Dysfunction medicine “cool” rather than clinical or embarrassing.

HIMS has positioned itself with a first mover advantage in the personalized healthcare and wellness industry. Its focus on:

* Personalized treatments
* Combination medications
* Direct-to-consumer accessibility

…makes it a unique player in the telehealth space.

# Convenience & Consumer Experience

The U.S. healthcare system is a nightmare for many - complicated, expensive, and frustrating. Long wait times, insurance headaches, and unclear pricing leave patients feeling powerless. HIMS provides an alternative with a consumer-first approach that eliminates these barriers.

* Accessibility – No waiting rooms. No insurance approvals. Just frictionless, direct-to-consumer care.
* Discretion – Patients can access treatments privately and comfortably.
* Transparent Pricing – Consumers know exactly what they’re paying before they commit.

Unlike traditional healthcare, where patients feel like passive participants, HIMS allows consumers to take control of their health.

The out-of-pocket cost of care continues to rise, with more Americans opting for high-deductible plans. As co-pays and other expenses grow faster than inflation, affordability is an increasing concern. HIMS is well-positioned within this cash-pay segment, offering upfront pricing and a premium experience.

From discreet online consultations to direct-to-door delivery, HIMS is designed for convenience. Consumers can browse treatments, receive personalized recommendations, and have medications shipped - all from their phone or computer. This retail-like approach makes healthcare as simple as shopping online, removing the stigma and complexity that often deter people from seeking treatment.

Unlike traditional telehealth models that feel transactional and impersonal, HIMS created a premium consumer engagement. Rather than passively following doctor’s orders, users customize their care, select treatments, and interact with a brand that prioritizes them.

In a world where convenience, transparency, and trust drive consumer decisions, HIMS offers a modern and approachable healthcare experience, a key differentiator.

I believe HIMS has and is continuing to grow their brand moat as a trusted, transparent, premium, personalized health and wellness provider that brings a consumer experience to the healthcare system.

# Regarding Share Dilution: A Manageable Concern

HIMS has been diluting shares at about 8% per year, which isn’t ideal. It is important to understand that HIMS is a young, high-growth company that is utilizing Share Based Compensation to attract, retain, and incentivize talent. Free cash flow growth is rapidly outpacing share-based compensation. I believe the impact of Shared Based Compensation to be reasonable and manageable and will minimize over time.

# Growth Opportunities & Catalysts

* **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** 100M+ Americans suffer from weight-related health problems.
* **New Categories:** HIMS plans to launch 1-2 major new categories annually. Of focus with new acquisitions: low testosterone, menopause support, and peptides.
* **At-Home Lab Testing:** New service offering that will support fricitionless access to hormonal treatment via HIMS while expanding personalized, data-driven care. Paired with MedMatch, HIMS' AI-driven treatment-matching service, at-home lab testing enhances the ability to identify additional products for consumer benefit. Utilizing data to personalize the consumer experience, increasing offerings and awareness of appropriate products based on data driven needs may lead to increased cross selling.
* **Subscription Growth:** CEO Andrew Dudum aims for 10M subscribers, a realistic target based on historical trends. On the earnings call, Dudum noted: ***""I think 10 million subs on the platform to me feels really quite in reach. And I think, frankly, pretty straightforward from a growth standpoint if you look at historical growth over the last five to six years. My optimistic hope and personally ambition would be to try to achieve this in the next five to six years.""***

In addition, average revenue per subscriber is becoming a larger driver of revenue growth: ***""While the addition of subscribers remains the primary component of our growth, monthly online average revenue per subscriber is becoming a more meaningful contributor as well. Monthly online average revenue per subscriber increased 38% year-over-year to $73 in the fourth quarter.""***

This is a positive long-term trend, though the recent spike was undoubtedly impacted by the sales of higher-priced GLP-1 products.

# Risks & Challenges

* **Regulatory Risk:** As always, there are regulatory risks for healthcare companies (and opportunities - i.e. favorable changes to compounding regulations).
* **GLP-1 Competition:** Commercial semaglutide providers are working hard to limit access to compounded GLP-1. In addition, a direct-to-consumer cash option for Wegovy has been released but remains more than 2x the cost of HIMS offering. (Again, I see GLP-1 as a bonus here, not a core tenet of the HIMS thesis.)
* **Execution Risk:** The recent FDA ruling on GLP-1 has put HIMS under increased scrutiny. Fortunately, the decision came before earnings, allowing the company to adjust its guidance and answer questions. Despite this, HIMS maintained a strong outlook, reflecting confidence in its execution of weight-loss products. While I’ve never viewed HIMS as purely a GLP-1 investment, it will be important to see how their estimations of personalized GLP-1 offerings and transition to aliterate weight loss products delivers.

# Valuation:

Keep in mind that all of my calculations are estimates, intended to provide general guidelines for my personal decision-making.

# Multiple Valuation: Price/Sales

During the Q4 2024 earnings call, HIMS CEO Andrew Dudum reiterated confidence in the company’s long-term growth trajectory, stating that the goal of reaching 10 million subscribers was well within reach: **""I think 10 million subs on the platform to me feels really quite in reach. And I think, frankly, pretty straightforward from a growth standpoint if you look at historical growth over the last five to six years. My optimistic hope and personally ambition would be to try to achieve this in the next five to six years.""**

With this target in mind, let’s assess a potential share price through the lens of the Price-to-Sales ratio, using Dudum’s stated goal alongside Monthly Average Revenue Per Subscriber (ARPU).

In Q4 2024, HIMS reported a Monthly ARPU of $73. However, this figure was temporarily elevated by GLP-1 prescriptions. A more balanced estimate comes from the full-year 2024 average, which stood at $63 per subscriber per month. We’ll use this more conservative metric for our valuation.

# Determination:

I believe HIMS is a great, fast-growing, yet volatile company that remains undervalued. I first invested after its initial quarter of profitability, starting at $12 and averaging up to $15.89 before Q4 earnings. Prior to Q4 earning, I felt a FV of HIMS was around $57 and was comfortable purchasing below $45. Following the post-earnings dip, I added in the mid-$30s, bringing my cost basis to $27.10.

Despite concerns over GLP-1, I see the reaction as overblown. My long-term conviction remains intact, and I continue to believe in 10x+ potential over the next decade.

Currently, HIMS is at my target portfolio weighting, but I’d consider adding more if the stock remains in the low-$30s to high-$20s. Based on a 20% margin of safety using a 25% free cash flow growth rate discounted at 10%, I view $46.64 and below as an attractive price. Purchasing in the low-$30s aligns with the more cautious 6 million subscriber scenario.

HIMS isn’t just a GLP-1 stock—it’s a disruptive healthcare brand. The business continues to scale, expand, and differentiate itself, making it a compelling long-term investment opportunity.

# Position:

**Doubling down this week if we remain in mid-30s.**

2025-03-24 15:49:19,HUYA - 41% Yield - WSB DD!,StockAstro,33,"Time for some good old fashioned DD! 

HUYA is the ultimate buy of 2025, let me tell you why. 

First off, China stocks are soaring, nearly every major institution is going long China. HUYA is best of class, owned by Tencent, the management team is all Tencent, one of the best operators in China and here’s the kicker .. HUYA has NO DEBT and $900 Million in cash, current market cap 750M .. YES, you read that correct they are trading for less than their CASH balance. It makes NO sense, and I believe it will be corrected quickly. 

HUYA just announced MAJOR news - they are retuning 50% of their market cap back to investors in COLD HARD CASH. HUYA is paying a $1.47 cent dividend in July. That is a 41% dividend yield ! The stock is currently $3.25 per share. Buying now will give you a cost avg around $1.80 for a Tencent Backed growing company. Very few times in life will you find a 40% yield on your cash, this is one of them. 

More news, they are buying back $100M worth of stock. They bought $1M worth of their own shares in ONE DAY and The CEO made an announcement, “we feel the stock price does not accurately reflect the business or future of the company.” For those that follow China stocks, BABA made an almost identical statement around $72 per share, now look at BABA (up 100% from that announcement) 

Next; PATTERNS …. Last year HUYA announced a large dividend of $1.07 - over the following month the stock climbed the entire amount of the dividend plus much more. People, institutions, etc will pour into this company to lock in that massive 40% divided. I expect the stock to climb at least the amount of dividend plus some before July. 

For every 10,000 shares of HUYA you own, you are making $14,700 in cash payment just this year. In my opinion this stock should return to $6.50 before dividend - meaning 100% gains, plus 40% dividend yield. 

HUYA is the best stock in the market at this moment. 

Position: LONG 41,000 shares, with plans to buy much more on any dip. ",https://i.redd.it/00cn96efsnqe1.jpeg,https://i.redd.it/00cn96efsnqe1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jitwaf/huya_41_yield_wsb_dd/
2025-03-24 15:27:56,Again new post the Insiders #HaveSpoken,Key_Elephant_5518,275,"1. **Markets Are Rallying - But Don’t Let That Fool You** Hey! Happy Monday. Yes, stocks are flying higher today. The Dow jumped almost 400 points before the open. And yes, the mood on Wall Street is suddenly… cheerful. **But don’t get too comfortable.** Because under the surface, nothing has actually changed. The reason for this bounce? Trump. Tariffs. And a little dose of wishful thinking.
2. **Let’s break down what’s really happening** Over the weekend, *Bloomberg* and *The Wall Street Journal* dropped some reports that lit a fire under the market. Here’s what they said:So now, the narrative is: “Maybe the tariffs won’t be that bad after all.” And just like that, **risk is back on**. **Wall Street’s playing a dangerous game here** Make no mistake - **the tariffs are still coming**. That part hasn’t changed. The only thing that’s shifted is the tone. It’s softer. A bit more “flexible.” But structurally Trump’s whole economic plan is still about dismantling globalization, forcing production back into the U.S., and making imported goods more expensive. That *will* hit supply chains. Especially the ones that depend on semi-finished goods moving back and forth across borders. And that’s what’s making investors uneasy - even as the market rallies.1
   * Trump’s planned *reciprocal tariffs* \- which are set to be announced April 2 - may not be as brutal as people feared.
   * There could be **exceptions for certain countries**.
   * They may not directly target specific industries like autos, semiconductors, and pharma after all.
   * And Trump hasn’t reacted to the leaks yet - which is giving investors a strange kind of hope.
3. **Here’s what’s adding fuel to the fire this week**Put all that together, and you’ve got a technical rally. **But it’s not about confidence in the economy.** It’s just positioning, timing, and a bit of blind optimism. **What about earnings?** It’s a quiet week.Economic data... same story.
4. So overall, **no major landmines this week**, and that’s helping keep the risk-on mood alive.11
   1. **Seasonal flows**: Historically, from late March through mid-April, capital flows tend to support U.S. equities. It’s been that way since 1928. Nothing magical - just calendar-based inflows.
   2. **Pension buying**: Goldman Sachs estimates pension funds will buy around **$29 billion in U.S. stocks** this week as they rebalance at the end of Q1.
   3. **CTAs (trend-following funds)** are switching: These quant-driven funds were heavily short. Now their models are flipping neutral or bullish - adding more buying pressure across the board.
   * Tonight: KB Home reports after the close.
   * Later this week: Dollar Tree, Paychex, Jefferies, Lululemon - a few names, but no heavy hitters.
   * Nothing that’s likely to shake the market.
   * Today we got flash PMIs. Manufacturing ticked up a bit (52.7), services slightly weaker (51.2). Nothing shocking.
   * Friday brings the PCE inflation data - the Fed’s favorite gauge - but expectations are muted.
5. **Meanwhile, China is making moves too** According to *The Wall Street Journal*, China is considering **export restrictions** aimed at the U.S. That’s a signal: they’re trying to ease tensions, maybe offer a trade olive branch ahead of the April 2 announcements. There’s also talk of a Trump-Xi conversation in April - possibly a symbolic birthday summit (they were born a day apart). That could help dial things down. Or not. **Let’s zoom out for a second** This rally is happening in the middle of a much bigger shift:You couldn’t make this stuff up. Hardliners are pushing for aggressive trade action - and they’ve said openly, **a recession is “worth it”** if it means reshaping the U.S. economy.
   * **Foreign investors are pulling money out of U.S. stocks.**
   * The **Dow-to-Gold ratio** is starting to break down - a pattern that tends to show up before major crises.
   * Corporate earnings **are falling**, even as prices climb. 
   * You couldn’t make this stuff up. Hardliners are pushing for aggressive trade action - and they’ve said openly, **a recession is “worth it”** if it means reshaping the U.S. economy.

1. It’s not strength. It’s a relief bounce.All it takes is one Trump tweet, one policy change, one unexpected reaction from China - and this whole thing could reverse fast. Keep your guard up. **Hope is not a hedge.**
   * The tariff threat *isn’t gone*, just temporarily softened.
   * Seasonality and positioning are doing the heavy lifting.
   * But the deeper risks - falling earnings, policy instability, deglobalization - haven’t gone anywhere.

All it takes is one Trump tweet, one policy change, one unexpected reaction from China - and this whole thing could reverse fast. Keep your guard up. **Hope is not a hedge.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jitdqw/again_new_post_the_insiders_havespoken/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jitdqw/again_new_post_the_insiders_havespoken/

The positive news came just two weeks after the company's lunar lander mission [ended](https://www.investopedia.com/intuitive-machines-stock-sinks-for-second-day-after-moon-mission-mishap-11692855) following a landing mishap, which had sent shares tumbling.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

2025-03-24 01:21:41,Turkey's economic collapse imminent,Tate-s-ExitLiquidity,4545,"**TLDR: Aug 15'25 $TUR $30 Put Market to Open tomorrow morning if trading allowed and here's why:**

* Political unrest amid jailing political opponents
* Just today opposing party leaders announced widespread boycotts - 50m+ people total cohort size
* Turkey's current financial system is flawed, they rely on high interest government bond sales to finance USD-TRY imbalance 

1. **Analysis of Current Reserves:**

* As of March 2025, Turkey’s total (gross) foreign exchange reserves are approximately **$85 billion**.
* However, most of these reserves consist of swap agreements and external debts; the actual (net) reserves are likely close to zero or even negative.
* The truly available (liquid) reserves for rapid intervention are, at best, around **$20–40 billion**.

2. **Activities That Could Rapidly Erode Reserves and Their Effects (Data Supported):**

The following scenarios could rapidly deplete the reserves in the short term:

**Mass Bond Sales and Foreign Exchange Purchases**

* If 30 million people convert an average of **$500** per person from TRY to USD, it would result in a reserve loss of **$15 billion** in a short time.
* *(30 million people × $500 = $15 billion)*

• **Mass Withdrawal of Deposits from Banks (Bank Panic)**

* The total deposits in the Turkish banking system amount to approximately **$450 billion**.
* Even if only **5%** of these deposits are withdrawn in a panic (about **$22.5 billion**), it could deplete more than half of the reserves in one go.

**Tax Payment Refusals and Consumer Boycotts**

* Turkey’s annual tax revenue is approximately **$150 billion** (2024 budget).
* Even a short-term **20%** tax boycott (a loss of about **$2.5 billion per month**) would create a serious budget deficit within a few months.

**Boycotts of Critical Sectors such as Energy and Transportation**

* Turkey’s monthly energy imports average about **$5 billion**.
* Even an extra crisis cost of **20%** in this area could result in an additional monthly reserve loss of **$1 billion**.

**Widespread Labor Strikes**

* A general strike lasting just one week in Turkey would cost approximately **$4–5 billion**.
* Strikes lasting several weeks could rapidly deplete the reserves.

👉 **Total estimated short-term reserve loss (within one month):**

It could be around **$20–40 billion**, which is nearly equivalent to all of Turkey’s actual liquid reserves.

3. **Timeline Scenarios for Collapse (Supported by Figures):**

🔴 **Aggressive Scenario (Full Bank Attack and Demand for Foreign Exchange):**

* If **10%** of bank deposits are withdrawn, it would create a cash need of about **$45 billion**.
* The current liquid reserves (assumed to be around **$30 billion**) would not be able to meet this demand.
* The economy and banking sector could collapse within **7–14 days**.

🟠 **Moderate Scenario (Partial Capital Outflow and Consumer Boycotts):**

* Demand for foreign exchange, tax losses, and reduced consumption would push the monthly reserve loss to around **$5–10 billion**.
* The existing reserves could be depleted in about **2–3 months**, bringing the economic crisis to a critical point.

🟡 **Controlled Scenario (Strict Capital Controls and External Financial Support):**

* Capital outflows could be limited to **$1–2 billion per month**.
* With IMF or external support (for example, **$10–15 billion**), the endurance of reserves could be extended to **6–12 months**.

I think this will lead to a government shutdown or change of power in the end. I don't see a humane way current government regaining back control without going bankrupt. If they do, it will be through terrorizing their own people and hijacking their bank accounts and other assets. If you make money out of this, I will suggest you sell when you see decent profits and buy yourself something nice. Be quick to exit this one.

EDIT: Turkey just BANNED short selling on the Istanbul Stock Exchange for one month.

When short selling is banned, you know that BIG TROUBLES are always right around the corner.

Stay tuned.

UPDATE: Turkey used a stunning $27BN in reserves to stabilize FX. Given recent reserve losses (USD 27bn), there is already large-scale short-term damage.

2025-03-23 20:04:30,SPY to 420,TopherBrennan,420,"This is a weird post to write because half the people reading it are going to respond with *no fucking shit* but I'm seeing everyone from random WSB shitposters to fancy-pants investment bankers saying we've found the bottom so let's fucking do this.

The Atlanta Fed's [GDPNow](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) currently has a -1.8% annualized decline in real GDP for Q1 2025. What does that mean? Well, the [BEA](https://www.bea.gov/help/glossary/recession) will tell you that ""the often-cited identification of a recession with two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth is not an official designation"" and ""the designation of a recession is the province of a committee of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)""—but that two quarters of negative GDP growth definition is pretty useful in practice. One quarter of economic contraction can be quickly forgotten, but two is generally a sign something is seriously wrong.

A -1.8% annualized decline in one quarter is only like a -0.45% actual decline, but be honest with yourself: does it look like we're fucking done? GDPNow's methodology is similar to the BEA's except that instead of waiting for all the data to come in they update it continuously as new data is released. That does mean the decline could shrink as more data comes in—but it also means the inputs are all stuff that's already actually happened, stuff like ""construction spending"" and ""retail sales"". It doesn't even try to model the effects of leading indicators like [collapsing consumer sentiment](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/university-of-michigan-consumer-sentiment-survey-drops-in-march-to-57point9-worse-than-expected.html), much less predict the future effects of policy changes.

So let's talk about those policy changes, starting with tariffs, since those have been getting a lot of attention. We seem to be at the stage where people who want to believe everything's going to be OK are combing through Trump's statements for whatever scraps of reassurance they can find, which they can do because of Trump's tendency to speak in word-salad and promise everything to everyone.

For example, here's an [answer](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/trump-says-therell-be-flexibility-on-reciprocal-tariffs.html) he gave  on Friday to a question in an Oval Office press conference (transcription mine):

>People are coming to me and talking about tariffs and a lot of people are asking me if they can have exceptions, and once you do that for one you have to do that for all, so I mean generally, I did something interestingly during two weeks ago, I gave the American car companies a break because it would've been unfair if I didn't and everybody said ""oh he changed his mind on tariffs!"" I didn't change my mind I helped our, you know, sort of big three, big four, I helped some of the American companies and instead of taking it properly they said ""oh he changed his—"" I don't change, but the world ""flexibility""'s an important word, sometimes there's flexibility, so there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal so that if China's charging us 50% or 30% or 20%, and I don't mean China I mean anybody, any country, Canada, nobody knows that Canada's charging our dairy farmers, they have 270% tariffs, nobody knows that, nobody knows that, they have up to 400%, they have a couple of tariffs, at 400%, nobody knows that, nobody talks about that.

He then went off on an extended tangent about why Canada should be a US state before ending by reiterating that ""nobody knows that they were getting 270% tariffs on dairy products"". And people have, in apparent seriousness, cited this answer as a reason for optimism, because he said there will be flexibility! Beyond the obvious rebuttals, it should be noted that the example he gave of ""flexibility"" was a [one-month pause](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-lutnick-2b269614084027a4894aa14f3dc16227), meaning tariffs are still coming for U.S. automakers.

The economic effects of mass-firings, along with cancelling leases and other contracts, don't get discussed as much. But they'll likely be quite serious. Mass-firings of federal workers could have an apocalyptic effect on the economies of Virginia and Maryland, effects by no means limits to the public sector, because those public sector employees are going to have to cut their spending at countless private businesses. Similarly, cancellation of leases threatens to crash real estate markets.

And while the many of the effects may be concentrated in the DC metro area, there are major government offices spread throughout the country, so the mass-firings and lease cancellations will create little pockets of economic pain everywhere. Some effects may even be concentrated in rural areas—like the effects of [cancelling contracts to buy food from American farmers to distribute as food aid](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311663/farmers-will-be-hit-hard-by-the-dismantling-of-usaid).

Then there's the fact that many of the fired federal workers were actually doing stuff that's really important for the US economy to functions. Firing FAA workers threatens to hurt airlines and domestic tourism. Firing people at the CDC makes it harder to fight bird flu, which is bad not just for the egg industry but also beef and dairy. And so on.

Finally there's Trump's immigration policies, whose effects range from farm workers being afraid to show up for work to completely fucking international tourism because apparently multi-week detentions of random tourists from [Europe](https://apnews.com/article/border-tourists-german-canadian-detention-immigration-408cd27338e8065268fabc835f8b0c34) and [Canada](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney) is a thing we're doing now. Recently there was a forecast of a [5% decline in international tourism](https://fortune.com/2025/03/17/foreign-tourism-us-forecast-trump-tariffs-trade-war-russia-ukraine-war/) which under the circumstances actually strikes me as optimistic.

I suspect the main reason a lot of people resist seeing what's staring them in the face is that during Trump's first administration the economy did okay until COVID hit. ""Util COVID hit"" is a pretty big caveat, especially with RFK Jr. running HHS, but never mind that. The bigger issue is that during his first term, there were still people in both the Republican congressional caucuses and his own administration willing to tell Trump ""no"". We don't seem to have that anymore, unless you count X Æ A-12 telling him to ""shush"".

So TLDR; all signs point to us already having experienced an economic contraction in Q1 2025, and there's every reason to expect it to continue into Q2 and beyond. A recession, in other words. Of course, the question we all want to know on WallStreetBets is what this means for the stock market.

Faithful believers in the efficient market hypothesis will insist everything I've described and more is already ""priced in"", to which I say: LOL. So far the S&P 500 has fallen 10% peak to trough, but a 10% drop is a fucking sneeze by stock market standards. I remember back in 2015 when my boss told me he was selling all his stocks because of some bullshit with China. I *didn't* sell because I didn't want to be the guy who sold at the bottom, but by the time the 2015-2016 selloff was over the S&P 500 was down 14%—over fucking *nothing*.

An actual recession probably means a much more severe decline in stock prices. If I believed Trump administration messaging about [""temporary pain""](https://gazette.com/news/wex/trump-officials-acknowledge-temporary-pain-amid-tariffs-and-market-unease/article_0186aba5-768e-572d-be2f-e9f2ef31ecbf.html), the precedent I'd be looking at is Paul Volker more or less causing a recession on purpose to fight inflation, which involved a 27% decline in the S&P 500. But Trump and Musk aren't Paul fucking Volker, so I'm expecting a greater than 30% decline.

How much more than 30%? Beats me, but assuming a decline of 31.5% decline from SPY's $612.93 peak yields a nice, easy-to-remember target price of $420. It could easily go even lower, but will almost certainly bounce back, and a lot of people aren't going to want to miss the recovery. Therefore, I wouldn't feel too stupid going long SPY at $420. At its current price, though, count me out.

So what do you do about it? Full-porting SPY 12/31 430p is obviously insanely risky. And unfortunately, given the range of tail-risks we're facing—the debt ceiling, Trump deciding to actually act on [previous comments that much US government debt might be fraudulent](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud), or even fucking with the banking system—I don't think any position is entirely safe. That said, here's what I've currently got.

2025-03-23 15:35:07,Is the sell off of overvalued stocks to retail the savior of our economy?,Educational_Face_610,452,"So I have been thinking. What if the selling of all overvalued stocks and basically shit to retail the smartes move for Big Institutions? 2008 happened because institutions tried to sell each other the hot potato quickly devaluating everything until one got stuck with a huge pile of shit and had to go bankrupt and the rest had to be saved by the government and its taxpayers.

What if they learned from it (smth very unlike but there is a small chance they did) and decided the best way to go is to animate the retailers to buy a big chunk of that shit so that on their books they only hold a small part of it and the loses are mainly eaten up by retail?

I know this sounds weird because either way retail gets fucked but in this option no institution has to go bankrupt or have to receive hate from general population since they can simply say: hey guys you decided to invest in smth that is highly speculative you lost it on your own, but look at us since we are pros at this we didn’t loose as much. 
Unlike if they would loose it it would be more of a: hey guys we tried reaching for the sun and got burned in the process. 

Which in turn would explain the massive push for alternative trading platforms such as Robinhood and other online retail options. It’s just a hedge of huge institutions to make sure that when shit hits the fan they aren’t the ones holding it.

Instead of discounting each period's cash flow and adding them up, I decided to discount the net income in each period (using SoFi's cost of equity estimate) instead and then multiply that by the mean P/E ratio estimate for the finance industry, essentially deriving the stock price in today's value for each period of earnings. Finally, I averaged the results to find the price target for SoFi.

**Is this a methodologically correct method of financial modeling? No**, but I believe that this is a way to keep in mind the time value of money when evaluating P/E ratio ahead of today's earnings period.

**My conclusion is that SoFi is underpriced and has a decent upside ahead.** Please be mindful that the model's assumptions are not grounded on a scientific basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions could result in a drastically different conclusion.

Lastly, I understand that the extension of forecasted periods would ultimately result in the target price in future periods converging to zero as the discount factor increases exponentially, so the result I have is also highly dependent on how many forecast periods to include. For good measure, I decided to extend for 5 more years after the member growth is expected to stabilize at 3%.

Started with SPY 564 calls 0DTE. Market went more sideways than my trading strategy. Cut losses at -20%.

In true smooth-brain fashion, took my remaining cash and YOLOed 1000 contracts of SPY 563 calls at 3:40pm. $16k on paper tickets with 20 minutes to expiry.

Hit $190k at peak then Questrade decided to ""risk review"" me for 30 seconds. Cost me about $85k when I couldn't sell at the top. Still escaped with $103k profit.

Thought I was gonna start working at Wendy's, but the last 10 minutes changed everything.
Seriously though, that last 15 mins of trading was pure insanity - never doing that again. Like a Boomer, I'm going to invest these gains in IXUS and XEQT instead of trying my luck next week.

I wouldn't be surprised if his FTC threatens to block them in an effort to extract something from the biggest shareholders involved.

Right now Kellanova ($K) is trading pretty evenly below its $83.5 buyout price but I bet a dip is to come from FTC threats similar to what we've seen recently with Discover Financial Services ($DFS).

2025-03-21 16:58:08,"UAE commits to $1.4 trillion US investment, White House says",callsonreddit,2185,"WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates has committed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework in the United States after top UAE officials met President Donald Trump this week, the White House said on Friday.

The framework will ""substantially increase the UAE's existing investments in the U.S. economy"" in AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, and manufacturing, the White House said in a statement.

The White House did not outline how UAE investments would reach $1.4 trillion, with some of the deals unveiled as part of the framework having already been announced.

The only fully new deal appeared to be an investment by Emirates Global Aluminium in what would be the first new aluminum smelter in the United States in 35 years, the White House said, adding the plant ""would nearly double U.S. domestic aluminum production"".

""Developing a primary aluminium smelter in the U.S. has been part of EGA's ambitions for several years,"" a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement.

The UAE, an oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S., is looking to deepen investment ties with Washington and is emerging as a global leader in AI, one of the sectors it is betting on to diversify its economy away from energy.

In September, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met former U.S. President Joe Biden, in the first visit of a UAE president to the White House, as the two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in areas such as AI, investments and space exploration.

Gulf sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi's $330-billion Mubadala, are already big U.S. investors, and Trump and his family have business ties to the region.

OVAL OFFICE MEETING

Trump in January asked Saudi Arabia to spend upwards of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy, over four years, including purchases of military equipment, and said this month he likely would make his first trip abroad to the Gulf country to seal an investment agreement.

The deal, which could happen between this month or the next, would come at a time when Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's biggest economy, has been taking a more prominent role in U.S. foreign policy. The Gulf country is set to host diplomatic talks around Ukraine involving the United States and Russia next week.

The White House said on Friday the UAE agreement resulted from a meeting that Trump held on Tuesday with national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the Oval Office and a dinner that Vice President JD Vance and several cabinet members held with the UAE delegation, which included the heads of major UAE sovereign wealth funds and corporations.

Among the tie-ups highlighted on Friday was a partnership between UAE sovereign wealth fund ADQ, which is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon, and U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners, for a $25 billion U.S.-focused initiative to invest in energy infrastructure and data centers. That had been previously announced two days ago.

A commitment by XRG, the international investment arm of UAE state oil company ADNOC launched in November, to support U.S. natural gas production and exports with an investment in the NextDecade liquefied natural gas export facility in Texas, had previously been made public last year by ADNOC, under Biden.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-meeting-uae-commits-10-134941173.html,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jglmnx/uae_commits_to_14_trillion_us_investment_white/

2025-03-21 16:08:55,RIVN a quick technical analysis backed by underlying drivers,stonkautist69,71,"This is my first dd post and it’s mostly a look at  the technical chart with some flavorings of qualitative analysis driving this on the back end. No chatgpt and I am highly regarded. 

**First point: reverse head and shoulders**

A. initial low post ipo slide @$11.68

B. one higher low in late 2023 @$15.12

C. ATL early 2024 @$8.26

D. Higher low late 2024 @$9.50

In these 4 points(circled in graph), is developing, somewhat of a reverse head and shoulders pattern, I believe there might be opportunity for breakout, especially after the recent market wide selloff driving higher risk stocks like RIVN down sharply. Confirmation would be around $15-16 and I believe this could bring it to the $20-35 range

**Second point: Descending triangle Sellers meeting buyers floor**

As seen in the chart, there is a clear series of lower highs(blue downward sloping line), and support from buyers around $11. The price has been flirting with the upward trend line, and I believe there are two scenarios. 

1. The stocks goes sharply lower, driven by broader market forces, marking it’s capitulation and goes sharply higher from abysmal lows. 

2. Market trades sideways or upwards and RIVN starts an upward trend more gradually

Either way, I see an opportunity in trading this stock. With it losing $5.3B last year, I can’t convince myself to invest in it as a long term value play (my normal investments), but I can see it as an acquisition target from a bigger auto player or PE (private equity) fund who wants to get skin in the EV game, either of these two giving an insane valuation justification for short term trading. 

I wouldn’t be so confident in this if it weren’t for the, I guess I’ll call it, among other things.. “EV biased administration” and it’s partnership with players like Amazon and VW. 

I’m a buyer in the $7.75 - $9.50 range. Might buy some today just to get some skin in the game as I don’t hate it at $11.35, just don’t love it. 

Also, I think it’s important to note, I’m cautionary with options on this play, especially deep OTM Calls that will be worthless if an acquisition price is less than strike after a 30-40% pop from rumors of M&A (merger and acquisition).

2025-03-21 15:55:21,FedEx shares slide as annual forecast cuts stoke worries on economy,callsonreddit,301,"(Reuters) -FedEx's shares fell 11% on Friday after the parcel delivery firm cut its annual forecasts, fanning worries about the health of U.S. manufacturing amid uncertainty from the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on trading partners.

CEO Raj Subramaniam warned a day earlier that the company was navigating a very ""challenging operating environment"" and ""weakness in the industrial economy"" was weighing on its higher-margin business-to-business volumes.

The company's shares hit their lowest in nearly two years on Friday. FedEx and rival UPS are viewed as barometers for the global economy due to their involvement across a swathe of industries.

Shipments from companies that produce goods used in manufacturing drive substantial cargo volumes and high-margin deliveries for the delivery firms.

UPS' shares were down 3%, while European peer DHL fell 2.2%.

U.S. President Donald Trump's on-and-off import tariffs have created uncertainty for businesses, prompting them to be more cautious with their spending in an uncertain economic landscape.

Analysts have said Trump's levies could trigger a recession and a trade war, further hammering demand for transportation and delivery services.

""FedEx's Q3 print and full-year forecast cut will likely exacerbate concerns of structural pressures in the parcel business,"" Morgan Stanley said, adding that it may even overwhelm the company's cost-cutting program.

FedEx has been reducing costs as demand for lower-margin e-commerce deliveries from companies such as Temu and Shein outpaces higher-margin business-to-business shipments.

""Management noted weakness in the industrial economy and, while macro is a factor, we believe structural forces are a far bigger headwind than the market thinks,"" Morgan Stanley added.

The company lowered its fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $18.00 and $18.60, from $19 to $20 previously.

The forecast cut itself was far from a surprise, but the magnitude, particularly for one remaining quarter, was greater than feared, Evercore ISI said.

2025-03-21 10:26:17,Germany Set for Trillion-Euro Defense and Infrastructure Splurge,SunAdvanced7940,610,"Germany’s mammoth spending package cleared its last parliamentary hurdle, paving the way for as much as €1 trillion in civilian and defense investments to jolt the region’s economy and reduce its military reliance on the U.S.

But economists and defense experts have warned that for Germany and Europe to reap the full benefits, the wall of money would need to be flanked with ambitious—and not necessarily popular—structural overhauls, including tax, bureaucracy and labor-market reforms.

Germany’s spending plan, equivalent to around $1.08 trillion, has drawn cheers across a continent unnerved by signs that the U.S. is downgrading its security commitment to Europe and seeking a rapprochement with President Vladimir Putin’s Russia, which is seen as the region’s biggest threat.

“Berlin is breaking the piggy bank, and it’s doing it even before the next government is in office,” said François Heisbourg, a Paris-based expert on strategy and defense who has advised the French president. “Germany is giving itself the means to become a military force to match its economic and strategic weight. That’s a sea change.”

Friedrich Merz, winner of last month’s German election and the man in line to become chancellor, has pledged to focus on European cooperation after the departing government became increasingly distracted by internal frictions between the coalition’s three parties.

The German spending plan he developed marks a U-turn for Berlin, which for years preached fiscal discipline to its European neighbors while letting its military atrophy for lack of investment. The package’s scale dwarfs a €158 billion defense fund floated by the European Commission this month to support military spending in the European Union and fund future help for Ukraine. 

The German decision is especially credible, Heisbourg said, because it would directly benefit German arms manufacturers, including Rheinmetall, an armored-vehicle and ammunition manufacturer, and others that have proven their ability to deliver large orders quickly on behalf of Ukraine. 

The spending package is made possible by a constitutional amendment that effectively exempts defense-related spending from the provisions of Germany’s strict fiscal rules, which ban budget deficits bigger than 0.35% of gross domestic product. This exemption will apply not just to spending on military hardware but also on cybersecurity, intelligence and civil protection. 

Because Germany has relatively low public debt, the upshot is that it will from now on be able to spend as much on defense as investors are willing to lend it—at least and as long as overall spending doesn’t breach the EU’s more lenient spending rules. 

“The priority now is to make sure that the money is being spent efficiently and not only to plug gaps in hardware,” said Ben Schreer, executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Europe office in Berlin. “Now we have the possibility to think about the capacities that we need to build—in software, in artificial intelligence, in communications, in space—if we’re going to become less dependent on the U.S.”

The amendment also creates a €500 billion investment fund to be spent on the country’s long-neglected transport, communication, digital and power infrastructure as well as on measures to combat climate change, over the next 12 years.

The legislation was designed so that only new investment is eligible for funding—a provision meant to prevent existing investments from migrating from the ordinary budget into the fund.  

After the amendment gathered the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament on Tuesday and Friday, the package’s implementation will depend on detailed legislation that will be drafted when the next government takes office.

This is likely to happen at the end of April as Merz’s conservatives and their prospective center-left coalition partners are still locked in negotiations over the government’s policy agenda for the next four years. While the two buried their differences to push the spending package through, they remain at odds on issues ranging from how much should be done to combat illegal immigration to the merits of cutting income and corporate tax.

The spending package has caused some consternation in conservative ranks after Merz campaigned against relaxing the country’s fiscal rules. But most economists agree that the combination of rapid rearmament and much-needed infrastructure investments could be a boon for an economy that has barely grown since before the Covid-19 pandemic and has been in recession for the past two years.

The plan could help Germany’s GDP grow by 0.3% this year and 2.1% by 2027 if it is implemented quickly, according to insurer Allianz. While Germany’s public debt was set to fall rapidly on the previous spending trajectory, it could now reach 68% of GDP by 2027, Allianz said—still low by European and U.S. standards and likely without a sizable impact on the country’s funding costs. 

But the group’s economists also warned that unlocking and maintaining this level of growth over time without rekindling inflation would require Germany to implement a number of structural overhauls, including fixing its unsustainable pension system, increasing incentives to work and innovate, and cutting taxes, not all of which would be popular with voters.

Likewise, the economic fallout from the extra military spending would be biggest if Germany ensures most of the money is spent at home and in Europe and a substantial share of it goes to research and development, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. This would increase the likelihood that military innovations find their way into the private sector, thus boosting growth further. 

“The planned defense spending can give Germany a structural boost if it is spent correctly,” said Moritz Schularick, the institute’s president.

Analysts said the next government would also need to fix slow, bureaucratic and inefficient procurement processes at the Defense Ministry to ensure that the extra money borrowed on capital markets can actually be absorbed by the military.

2025-03-21 09:21:41,How Will Trump's Tariff Re-imposition Impact Global Financial Markets?,SerStaniS1av555,5,"With the first quarter of 2025 showing notable financial turbulence, one of the key drivers seems to be U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to re-impose tariffs. This move has caused a sharp drop in the S&P 500 as investors rapidly divest from U.S. equities, sparking a shift towards European and Chinese markets.

On top of that, emerging economies like Turkey, Indonesia, and Colombia are also feeling the pressure due to their own domestic political issues. With so much volatility, do you think this will lead to long-term instability in the global markets, or could this be a short-term reaction?

How should investors be responding to these market shifts? Are there any strategies you would recommend for navigating this financial uncertainty?

2025-03-20 22:32:24,"FedEx cuts full-year results forecast on ‘uncertainty’ in economy, bad weather",callsonreddit,610,"(Reuters) -FedEx Corp lowered its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Thursday, as the parcel delivery firm battles stubbornly soft demand and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on trading partners.

""Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy, which is constraining demand for our business-to-business services,"" Chief Financial Officer John Dietrich said in a statement.

FedEx shares were down 5.5% to $232.69 in after-hours trade, while rival United Parcel Service stock fell less than 1%. Those companies are seen as barometers for the global economy since their business touches so many types of businesses.

Both companies have been slashing costs as less lucrative e-commerce delivery demand outperforms that of higher-margin shipments between businesses.

The industrial sector includes firms that produce products used to make other goods. It drives significant cargo volume and more profitable deliveries for FedEx and UPS. Many executives in the U.S. transportation industry had been banking on the industrial economy returning to growth this year.

Those hopes appear to have been dented by new and threatened tariffs from the Trump administration. Experts are also concerned those import levies could spark a trade war that further weakens transportation and delivery demand.

Memphis-based FedEx on Thursday lowered its full-year forecast for adjusted profit to $18 to $18.60 per share. FedEx in December cut that profit forecast for the fiscal year ending May 2025 to $19 to $20 per share, down from its initial target range of $20 to $22 per share.

FedEx also expects revenue for the 12 months ending in May to be flat to slightly down year-on-year, versus its earlier forecast for it to be approximately flat.

For the third quarter that ended on February 28, FedEx reported adjusted profit per share of $4.51. that was up from $3.86 per share last year, but below average analyst estimates of $4.54, according to data compiled by LSEG.

FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said the results came as the company was ""navigating a very challenging operating environment, including a compressed peak season and severe weather events.""

FedEx and UPS are locked in a fierce battle for market share, which analysts worry could lead to a price war.

FedEx and the United States Postal Service, its largest customer, ended their air cargo contract in September. UPS picked up that business, but in January said it was accelerating a plan to slash deliveries for its largest customer, Amazon.com.

FedEx in December announced long-awaited plans to spin off its profitable Freight division, a move analysts said could unlock up to $20 billion in shareholder value while clearing the way for FedEx management to focus on merging operations of its separate Express and Ground units to boost profits.

FedEx executives said on Thursday that the company remained on track for permanent cost reductions of $2.2 billion for fiscal 2025.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-cuts-full-revenue-forecast-200944913.html,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jg1ont/fedex_cuts_fullyear_results_forecast_on/

2025-03-20 19:11:02,It’s time to call bullshit,AdamHorn8,3214,"I’ll share a screenshot of my positions in a thread below, so if that’s all you’re here for go ahead and look.

My fellow regards, I believe it’s time to call bullshit on this market. Please understand, I don’t care who you voted for… I guarantee I like you a hell of a lot more than I like the banks, and that is exactly who the winner is going to be unless people wake up to the reality of our situation quickly. 

Before touching any kind of political news, let’s start with market indicators. 

BofA’s recent mm survey showed that most MM’s are reducing their share of US equities (source 1 below), there are other signs the banks are getting out as well (check my second to last post), BlackRock is struggling to find buyers. 

At the same time, a record number of American households now own stock in US equities (source 2 below). Now, from what I know about American households (I live in one), most of us live paycheck to paycheck… we don’t really have money to put into stocks willy-nilly.


So what does all of this mean? 

Well, my thesis is that the average American has their rent/mortgage in US equities tied up in stocks like Tesla right now as an act of patriotism… what saddens me most is that I appreciate this general sentiment (not for Tesla necessarily, but I do actually love my country despite what the news may tell you), but the banks are taking advantage of it. So what happens when all the sudden everyone has to pay their bills? 

That’s right… another mass sell off. 

Please believe me when I say that I hope I’m wrong, this is not going to be good for average, working people with, at the very least, good-hearted intentions… but I don’t see any signs to indicate that I am.

Now we’ll touch a bit on economic outlook and history:

We are currently still in a battle with inflation, JPow said it yesterday, even before tariffs we were looking at 2 more years before we return to normal and the outlook with tariffs puts it all on pause. He hedged to say ‘they aren’t sure how tariffs will affect inflation’, let me fill in the gap there: either tariffs will affect inflation (because the costs are passed on to consumers) or they will affect earnings (because companies absorb them)… the money has to come from somewhere. If it affects inflation, the fed will be forced to raise interest rates or at the very least pause on cuts indefinitely. If it doesn’t affect inflation, it will affect earnings/growth… if this sounds familiar, then you may have heard of stagflation. And if you study the history of the federal reserve, you may know what the solution to that problem is… Volcker’s hammer. You can look it up yourself but the gist is that in the late 70’s we had been battling inflation and stagnant growth for years, until Paul Volcker was appointed to head the federal reserve and raised interest rates to 20%… it absolutely crushed the economy, sent us to the stone ages… but it did reset our inflation and led us into a very booming 80’s. 

I want to reiterate… I don’t like either side politically, they’re all in bed with the banks. The only reason I’m posting this is because I’m angry at the thought of them getting super leveraged on overpriced stocks and then dumping it on average people. This has so many shades of 2008 it’s not funny. Feel free to argue, bet against me, whatever… I genuinely don’t care. I’ve been a value investor since I was 14 and I’m currently 28. I held through 2020 and 2022, this time feels much much different. 

Whatever you decide to do with this information, be safe out there.

2025-03-20 18:52:00,Nvidia CEO Says He Was Surprised That Publicly Held Quantum Firms Exist,WillPill_,1186,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he didn’t realize there were publicly traded quantum-computing companies when he made earlier comments that caused industry stocks to crash.

“My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public. How can a quantum company be public?” Huang said at an event Thursday focused on the still-nascent technology.

The executive had said in January that “very useful” quantum computers are probably decades away, causing shares of IonQ Inc. and other companies to tumble. Thursday’s event — part of Nvidia’s weeklong GTC conference — invited some of those very companies on stage to discuss their prospects with Huang.

The quantum-computing industry aims to use the unique properties of subatomic particles to process data much faster than traditional semiconductor-based electronics. The technical difficulties of building practical systems have meant that the field is still in an experimental stage. In addition to quantum upstarts, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are also trying find practical uses for quantum systems.

The companies on stage at Thursday’s event included IonQ and D-Wave Quantum Inc. Huang said it was natural for this new form of computing to take many years to develop since it was so novel. The companies might be able to convince him that quantum computing is happening more quickly than he expected, he said. “But I don’t know,” he joked.

“This whole session is going to be like a therapy session for me,” he said.

The six company leaders on stage gave him a variety of answers. Some argued that quantum computers are already in use to solve difficult science problems. Others posited that the technology is even closer to helping advance traditional computing.

Executives also said it wasn’t unreasonable to spend a decade honing a technology that will have such a large impact. Loic Henriet, who runs the French company Pasqal, argued that the term “quantum computing” was misleading. Quantum processors will help act as accelerators — working alongside traditional computers — rather than replacing them, he said.

2025-03-20 18:50:24,Lyft to Offer Driverless Ride-Hails ‘as Soon as This Summer’,callsonreddit,133,"(Bloomberg) -- Lyft Inc. said it plans to offer driverless vehicles on its platform “as soon as this summer,” and that it sees human drivers transitioning to other work such as fleet management as autonomous rides become more ubiquitous.

The company has been spending more time pitching its vision for the future of its gig-economy business model as it plays catch-up in offering autonomous rides. Driverless ride-hailing has become more commonplace in some key US markets through competing platforms. Like rival Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft envisions a hybrid future where human drivers will complement autonomous vehicle fleets, especially during periods of peak demand.

The autonomous-vehicle economy will create new jobs such as remote vehicle support, fleet management, and map data labeling and validation, said Jeremy Bird, Lyft’s executive vice president in charge of driver experience, said Thursday in a blog post. He also confirmed the driverless service could begin as early as this summer. The company had previously committed to a launch sometime in 2025.

Bird also said the idea of drivers eventually owning autonomous vehicles is core to the company’s strategy, and this will become more feasible as the cost falls for those cars. That would enable drivers to operate small fleets, not unlike how some Airbnb Inc. hosts have made a business out of renting out multiple properties. Elon Musk has a similar vision in which Tesla owners would monetize their vehicles when they aren’t personally using them.

“Even when technology encroaches on human jobs, it doesn’t eliminate the need for humans altogether — especially when workers can provide value that the machines cannot,” Bird wrote. “Humans are features, not bugs, and we’ll continue to find a way to reward those that provide great service as part of a thriving hybrid network.”

Lyft and Uber currently rely on millions of drivers to quickly match with riders. But Lyft, which only operates in the US and Canada, is more exposed to increasing competition from domestic autonomous ride providers such as Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo.

Waymo began offering driverless service more broadly in major markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles last year, and has partnered exclusively with Uber to offer those rides in Austin starting this month. The two companies have a similar agreement to launch driverless trips in Atlanta this summer.

When Lyft launches its first driverless trips, it will be through existing partnerships, including with Toyota Motor Corp.-backed startup May Mobility in Atlanta.

Lyft shares have declined 9% since the start of the year, while Uber’s have gained 23% so far.

Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has gone so far as to predict that human drivers will eventually be displaced as autonomous software develops superior driving skills over the next 15 to 20 years. The company has made some early efforts to help create new earnings opportunities for its network of gig workers, including piloting a Taskrabbit-like service where customers can hire people to complete various household tasks. It’s also recruiting coders and language experts to fuel its new AI data labeling business.

In his blog post, Lyft’s Bird stopped short of predicting when drivers might be displaced, instead saying that driverless cars will create new opportunities for drivers. That includes manual work required to service, maintain and charge the vehicles. These are “jobs for which drivers are well suited,” Bird added.

The industry will also need customer service workers to respond to unusual events during driverless rides. In Lyft’s case, 30% of the staff working in its fleet management unit Flexdrive are former or current Lyft drivers, Bird wrote.

The company has also proposed ways for drivers to find jobs in other industries, offering free training to enter the tech industry. CEO David Risher also recently announced a new feature that uses AI to generate a recommendation letter, which active drivers in good standing can share with potential employers.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-offer-driverless-ride-hails-175137007.html,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jfwcij/lyft_to_offer_driverless_ridehails_as_soon_as/

2025-03-20 18:12:22,Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase,callsonreddit,1326,"Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

According to a report in the Information, Apple — which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout — has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

The update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.

Last year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.

It's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.

According to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.

Notably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like ""Severance,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""Ted Lasso."" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to ""Coda"").

In total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.

Apple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-is-reportedly-losing-1-billion-a-year-on-its-streaming-service-as-churn-levels-increase-172901811.html,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jfvft3/apple_is_reportedly_losing_1_billion_a_year_on/

2025-03-20 11:11:47,EU may delay first counter-tariffs against U.S. to mid-April,callsonreddit,360,"BRUSSELS, March 20 (Reuters) - The European Union could delay imposition of a first set of counter-measures against the United States over President Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs until mid-April, European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on Thursday.

The European Commission had proposed re-imposing tariffs on 4.5 billion euros ($4.9 billion) of U.S. products on April 1, followed by hitting a further 18 billion euros of U.S. goods on April 13.

""We are now considering to align the timing of the two sets of EU counter-measures so we can consult with member states on both lists simultaneously, and this would also give us extra time for negotiations with our American partners,"" Sefcovic told a hearing at the European Parliament.

The first set of EU counter-measures includes applying a 50% tariff on U.S. bourbon. Trump threatened to slap a 200% tariff on all wines and other alcoholic products coming from the EU if the bloc went ahead with this.

The Trump administration is also planning further tariffs on April 2.

French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said on Sunday that the EU was probably mistaken in targeting American whiskey, while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni cautioned EU partners on Tuesday against escalating the trade dispute with the United States.

""I am not certain that responding to tariffs with more tariffs is necessarily a good deal,"" Meloni, who is close to Trump, said.",https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/eu-may-delay-first-set-counter-tariffs-against-us-mid-april-2025-03-20/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jfmfnk/eu_may_delay_first_countertariffs_against_us_to/
2025-03-20 11:10:47,US companies race to secure import tariff exemptions after Trump pause,callsonreddit,621,"March 20 (Reuters) - Washington's temporary relief for import tariffs on goods covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has triggered a spike in US companies seeking exemption under the trade deal, industry experts said.

The White House slapped fresh 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico on March 5, but later announced that levies on goods covered under the USMCA would be delayed until April 2.

The USMCA grants preferential treatment to goods either sourced from or having a minimum percentage of value added in any of the three countries.

""We're seeing importers rush to become USMCA certified ... the risk is just too high not to,"" said Brian Riley, senior vice president of customs house brokerage at logistics firm GEODIS.

Some of the companies, mostly small businesses reliant on cross-border trade, are scrambling to verify if their products already qualify for exemptions.

At present, only 37.8% of imports from Canada and 48.9% from Mexico are eligible for duty-free status under the USMCA, an S&P Global Market Intelligence report showed.

To qualify, an importer must analyze the bill of materials - a list of all parts and materials used in a product - to determine if their goods meet requirements.

Mike Short, president of Global Forwarding at freight forwarder C.H. Robinson, said there was an increase of USMCA qualification and tariff classification requests even before the official announcement.

""Now that the official amendments are published, these requests have only increased, and we expect this trend to continue.""

Businesses earlier refrained from getting the certification due to its complexity and costs of meeting requirements, especially since their goods were already entering the U.S. duty free.

Even after certification, a company has to maintain detailed records for up to five years after import and ensure continued compliance.

""Companies are hedging their bets by becoming USMCA certified because what's to say the exemption may not continue after April 2? Or, if the exemption expires then, what if it returns in the near future?"" GEODIS' Riley said.

The uncertainty has prompted companies to overlook immediate cost-savings.

""If you are slapping 25-50% tariffs on everything, companies that never previously needed to are now forced to evaluate if this (USMCA certification) is an option,"" said Sung Choi, vice-president of product management at supply chain solutions provider e2open.",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-companies-race-secure-import-tariff-exemptions-after-trump-pause-2025-03-20/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jfmf49/us_companies_race_to_secure_import_tariff/

2025-03-20 09:41:06,Stop or GO for GO?(grocery outlet),BillyScheers,0,"I need to make you all aware of Grocery Outlet (GO)

 I wanted to bring some awareness to grocery outlet. it seems like with the way the economy is turning, with a dozen eggs or a bag of m&ms sitting at 10$, Grocery Outlet is going to be the store people start paying attention to for the hot deals. 



Grocery Outlet is a rapidly growing discount supermarket located mostly on the west coast. They are a chain known for offering brand-name groceries and quality products at discounted prices. They operate using a unique opportunistic buying model, purchasing surplus inventory, discontinued products, and closeout deals from manufacturers and retailers, which allows them to give customers good deals on quality products. 

I do think that they are due for a breakout, despite the fact that their stock has been consistantly bearish over the last few years. 

#######

1. **Recession-Proof during pandemics: Grocery Outlet crushes it during economic downturns. During 2020 (yall know what happened ) they saw growth of up to 50% over the year. As inflation squeezes consumers, they flock to bargain stores.**

2. **Rapid Expansion Mode:** They've been opening new stores aggressively, strategically targeting suburban markets. New stores mean more market penetration, higher revenue, and stronger growth potential. Last year they opened 67 new stores, only closing 2.

3. Insider buying: Director Thomas Herman recently bought around 10,000 shares in open market transactions (Source: Yahoo Finance, SEC filings). Insider buying like this indicates strong belief in the stock's upward trajectory.

4. **Undervalued Against Competitors:** Still undervalued compared to places like Dollar General or Aldi, Grocery Outlet offers major upside potential. I do think that they have more room to go down in price, possibly leading to better buying opportunities over the next year or two. 

5. **Personal Shopper Experience:** Personally, I regularly shop at Grocery Outlet and consistently find high-quality foods and goods at great prices. The store constantly rotates new products every month, keeping the shopping experience fresh and exciting. It's a great option for people like me who don't already have lots of extra money but prefer to purchase quality goods at lower prices. I generally get a better vibe shopping at a place like grocery outlet vs other discount grocery stores. It feels like a normal shopping experience, unlike Aldis where they make you bag your own groceries. 

 I'm just curious why the stock doesn't seem to get all that much volume compared to other retailers. I'm thinking of buying Long calls, but I'm also waiting to see how the price fluctuates before entering into a position over the next few months, perhaps waiting until their next earning? I'm also wondering how recent tarrifs or supply chain issues would affect GOs viability long term. What do you guys think? I think it's a stock worth observing and dca over the next year or two, or buying into long calls at cheap prices.

2025-03-20 00:51:14,'The arrival of the tariff inflation': Powell doesn't shy from linking trade to prices as Fed shifts forecasts,callsonreddit,2184,"Jerome Powell did not shy away from the impact of President Trump’s tariffs during a highly anticipated press conference Wednesday.

The Federal Reserve chairman said in no uncertain terms that Trump's trade agenda would be likely to drive up prices, even amid considerable uncertainty about exactly how much — and whether the price changes would be ""transitory.""

In just one example Wednesday afternoon during a question about price stability, Powell said that inflation had previously neared the Fed's key goal but now ""I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed.""

It was just one of numerous comments from the central banker that contrasted with past meetings where he often declined to weigh in on the topic in detail.

The remarks from Powell came after the Fed on Wednesday decided to hold interest rates steady and maintained a prediction of two rate cuts later this year.

What the central bank did change was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower). And those upward inflation adjustments, Powell said, are ""really due to the tariffs coming in.""

US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Monetary Policy Committee meeting, at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC on March 19, 2025. Powell said Wednesday that inflation has started to rise in part due to President Donald Trump\&#39;s tariffs, although stressing that it is tough to isolate the effects of levies on price increases. 

Some analysts raised questions about the Fed's unchanged overall prediction of two cuts this year even as Trump's trade policy has roiled markets and cut back projections of economic growth for the remainder of the year.

""We continue to think that Fed officials are underestimating the extent to which tariffs are likely to push up inflation,"" Capitol Economics said in a note immediately after Wednesday's decision but before the press conference.

Trump has already levied new duties on China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as on steel and aluminum in his first months in office, with a key deadline on April 2 threatening reciprocal tariffs that could be historic in their breadth and scope.

**A potential for 'transitory' tariff inflation**

At other points in his press conference Wednesday, Powell also repeatedly said that the exact effects of tariffs on prices were uncertain, may never be exactly known, and could even be temporary.

He called the price effects of tariffs potentially ""transitory"" — reusing a much-scrutinized word that was deployed by the Fed and other economic officials in 2021 as prices started to rise during Joe Biden's presidency.

Powell then called a transitory effect on prices ""kind of the base case but we really can't know that"" as he maintained the Fed's long-held wait-and-see approach to actually responding to Trump's still unfolding economic agenda.

But the use of the loaded word also led to some immediate critiques.

Mohamed A. El-Erian, the president of Queens' College, quickly posted, ""I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility.""

The centrality of tariffs also led to critiques from Democrats.

Daniel Hornung, deputy director of the National Economic Council under Joe Biden, said in a statement that the changed projections are ""all about tariffs and policy uncertainty,"" adding that ""these are the major factors standing in the way of interest rates coming down.""

Powell's acknowledgments Wednesday contrasted past Fed meetings, where Powell often made clear that Trump's incoming policies were on his mind without going into much detail on whether a new round of tariffs would cause inflation.

In one moment last December, Powell held up a September 2018 ""Tealbook"" simulation on tariffs and prices and called them ""a good starting point"" but declined to weigh in much further on then-President-elect Trump's policies.

At the Fed's last meeting in January, just days after Trump's inauguration, the committee noticeably removed language about inflation making progress toward its 2% inflation goal.

This time around, Powell was clear he viewed the tariffs as a headwind against his efforts to get inflation to its 2% target but maintained confidence that the central bank could handle it.

2025-03-19 22:28:58,What's TSLA worth in a fire sale?,TopherBrennan,467,"Occasionally, I see people suggest TSLA could go to $0. Obviously, any company can go to $0 if it's mismanaged for long enough, so sure, TSLA could go to $0. But some people have explicitly claimed that TSLA is basically a dead man walking, and could go to $0 any day now. This seems wrong, and it's kind of become a pet peeve for me.  
  
But what's the right answer? What's TSLA worth if tomorrow Elon Musk has a psychotic break tomorrow and is filmed running naked through the National Mall, a la the Kony 2012 guy?

Tesla's [most recent annual financial statement](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings) lists a ""stockholder's equity"" also known as book value, of $72.913 billion. Divide by 3.22 billion shares and you get the [reported of book value per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics/) $22.67. (My calculator says $22.64 but I assume that's a rounding error.)

That $72.913 billion book value comes from $122.070 billion in assets, including $58.360 billion in ""current assets"", less $48.390 billion in liabilities. Now according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_asset):

>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period.

If you look at the details of the balance sheet, the current assets are mostly stuff that would retain its value pretty well in a disaster, stuff like ""cash"" and ""short-term investments"". Strictly speaking if TSLA is holding a one-year bond its value on March 19th might be more or less than it was worth on December 31st, but assuming the value is unchanged isn't the worst assumption. The big exception, AFAICT, is ""inventory"", of which the balance sheet shows $12.017 billion.

Now, if you assume that when TMZ posts that naked Elon Musk video, all Tesla's inventory and all its non-current assets become worthless, yeah that bankrupts the company. But that's pretty clearly a bad assumption. The inventory might have to be marked down, but to $0? Maybe no hypothetical acquirer wants a Cybertruck factory, but factories can be retooled. Placing a market sell for Tesla's $1.076 billion worth of crypto might not return much cash, but presumably an acquirer wouldn't be that stupid. And I'm not an accountant, but ""deferred tax assets"" (valued at $6.524 billion) sound like something an acquirer might value at close to par?

So maybe we mark down Tesla's inventory by half (\~$6.009 billion); we mark down its crypto, which is overwhelmingly Bitcoin, based on how much Bitcoin has declined since December 31st (\~$0.078 billion), and we mark down other non-current assets (excepting deferred tax assets) by half (\~$28.133 billion), which gives us a fire sale value of about $38.69 billion or about $12/share.

I'm a software engineer, not an accountant or investment banker, so someone with more expertise in fundamentals analysis than I could probably come up with a better estimate than $12/share. But the fact remains you probably shouldn't place any bets that depend on TSLA going to $0 by end of next week.

Even though, yeah, fuck Elon.

Anyway, here's my position, which I'm holding today's movement be damned:

* White House official says tariffs to take effect April 2

* Bessent sees opportunity to negotiate tariffs lower
* USTR wrestling with design of complex reciprocal tariff plan

WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/) still intends for new reciprocal tariff rates to take effect on April 2, the White House said on Tuesday, despite earlier comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that indicated a possible delay in their activation.""The intent is to enact tariffs on April 2,"" the official said when asked to clarify Bessent's comments that countries would get an opportunity to avoid higher tariffs by reducing their own trade barriers.

""Unless the tariff and non-tariff barriers are equalized, or the U.S. has higher tariffs, the tariffs will go into effect,"" the White House official said.Bessent told Fox Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria"" program that Trump on April 2 would give trading partner countries a [reciprocal tariff](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-reciprocal-tariffs-coming-thursday-2025-02-13/) number that reflects their own rates, non-tariff trade barriers, currency practice and other factors, but could negotiate to avoid a ""tariff wall.""""On April 2, each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs,"" Bessent said. ""For some countries, it could be quite low, for some countries, it could be quite high.""""We are going to go to them and say, 'Look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labor suppression, and if you will stop this, we will not put up the tariff wall,'"" Bessent said of trading partners.""I'm optimistic that (on) April 2, some of the tariffs may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated, or that once countries receive their reciprocal tariff number, that right after that they will come to us and want to negotiate it down,"" Bessent said.Countries that fail to reduce their trade barriers will face [steeper tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) aimed at protecting the U.S. economy, its workers and industries, Bessent added.His remarks were taken to mean that while the proposed duties would be announced on April 2, their implementation could be delayed to allow time for negotiations. But the White House official said any such deals would need to be negotiated in advance to avoid the new tariffs.

# DETAILED WORK

The dueling comments illustrate the developing nature of Trump's new reciprocal tariffs just two weeks out from the April 2 activation deadline.Details of the plan are still being worked out, one White House official said, with much of the technical work on the expected tariffs being led by the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, headed by Jamieson Greer, and his staff of some 200 people at USTR.Vice President JD Vance has also played a more active role in the discussions in recent weeks, the official said.A spokesperson for USTR did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reciprocal tariff plan.Greer and his staff have been wrestling with how to design the reciprocal tariffs given each of the 186 members of the World Customs Organization has different duty rates, sources familiar with the process said.Calculating the tariff rates is complicated by Trump's vow to reflect the impact of non-tariff barriers, including taxes and other measures that U.S. officials argue give other countries’ firms an unfair advantage.At the Commerce and Treasury departments, political appointees have also run into hiring delays linked to vetting, which has created some negotiating bottlenecks, the same sources familiar with the process said.Financial markets have become increasingly nervous about the impact of Trump's tariffs and retaliation from trading partners will have on inflation and economic growth. U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision on Wednesday.

# TRIGGERING TALKS

The Trump administration expects the tariff announcements to trigger offers by affected countries to reduce their own tariffs or non-tariff measures, the official said, noting that India, for one, was already trying to get ahead of the U.S. moves.After Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-says-trump-has-clear-roadmap-second-term-2025-03-17/) and Trump met last month, the two nations agreed to resolve tariff rows and work on the first segment of a deal by the fall of 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade of $500 billion by 2030.

Trump often singles out India as the country with the highest average tariff rates, among top trading partners, while European Union countries are criticized for their high 10% car tariff rate, which is four times the 2.5% U.S. passenger car rate, but less than the 25% U.S. tariff on pickup trucks.Bessent said that the Trump administration is particularly focused on the 15% of countries that have the highest tariffs and large trading volumes with the U.S., which he referred to as the ""Dirty 15.""These countries also often have regulations governing domestic content or food safety that conspire to keep U.S. products out of their markets, he said.British business and trade minister Jonathan Reynolds came to Washington this week to meet in person with Lutnick and Greer, with both sides talking up the prospects of a bilateral trade deal focused on technology.Summary

# Introduction

Fellow regards, I’m sure we are all aware that the all Powell-ful Jerome will be determining, at the Fed meeting today, how hard a fucking our significant other’s boyfriend will be pumping out. Yet fewer have discussed what move they will be making based on this situation. My thesis is simple - the market has mispriced the chance of a rate cut, underestimating it, and so to take advantage of that, I have am in a long TLT position - a highly-leveragable, long-term government bond ETF. I’ll first explain why I think there’s a higher chance of a rate slash than the market is telling us, specifically diving into why the market has been mispriced. I’ll then move onto why this will cause TLT to rise, and also why I’ve chosen TLT over other related assets.

# Why an interest rate cut seems likely to me

Let’s start with some basic economics. Modern monetary theory suggests that the FED uses interest rate hikes to lower inflation at the cost of weakening the economy (raising unemployment), while cuts strengthen the economy while causing inflation. Here's how our situation looks to me:

First, consider inflation. To be completely honest, I have been working on this thesis since before the release of CPI data for February - personally, I expected annual inflation, from January to February, to fall from 3% to 2.9%. So, I waited until March 10th for a bit of confirmation bias. I was greeted by:

[Fig 1.1. CPI for February 2025, all goods](https://preview.redd.it/hr2m6snl1npe1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=30e0d3b370fff5664846a1fc00fcf019370518e0)

[Fig 1.2. 12-month inflation of February 2025, all goods](https://preview.redd.it/58duajjt1npe1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=7504887c1cdb54bb6655364ac732cd031b5fb310)

Inflation has retreated more than expected, falling to 2.8%. One of the many reasons why an interest rate cut initially seemed unlikely was  due to concerns of sticky inflation - this has provided evidence that inflation is falling. Granted, fed changes are not instant, and I’ll address fears regarding inflation later on in more detail. However, this data has shown us that inflation isn't as bad as we thought it'd be, and seems to be falling - evidence in favour of a rate cut happening. 

On the other hand, the economy:

[Fig 2.1. Consumer sentiment data](https://preview.redd.it/j9khkay22npe1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=3844b51954a3e6f01801e10ba3334e014d3d6713)

Consumer sentiment has completely crashed, falling 10% from Febuary to March, with expectations showing an even bleaker result

[Fig 2.2. Consumer spending falls in January 2025](https://preview.redd.it/dp7hgvg82npe1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc1d6630a4380931629607fe431db721b62a781)

Actual spending has also fallen - for the first time in a long time, people are spending less, despite easing inflation. And while preliminary data has appeared for February showing consumer spending has gone back up by 0.2%, this is still underperforming expectations. A weak consumer base, unwilling to spend, is never a good sign.

[Fig 2.3. ISM Manufacturing - PMI Index](https://preview.redd.it/cwzyk03j2npe1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0197772d801cd7f15e9f317e79c0199b0fb163d)

[Fig 2.4. A more detailed look at the index](https://preview.redd.it/eg6p861q2npe1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=9137514ca9dc0db417be1cd38bf9252c809451a0)

The manufacturing index has also seen better days. The manufacturing PMI has fallen from 50.9 to 50.3 in February. Now, in all fairness, this still means there is growth - any score above 50 indicates expansion - however, it means that growth is slowing down and seems to be at an inflection point, where it’ll start contracting again. Looking at the specifics, we also see details that show new orders and employment numbers are contracting, production and exports are seeing reduced growth, all while imports are growing at an accelerated pace. None of these show the signs of a confident economy. But perhaps most important to us degenerates, the stock market worries:

[Fig 2.5. Trillions wiped off the stock market in the last 2 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/0mndpd1v2npe1.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0a513492d726a76f2b3c57b054ac238b7e89f8f)

I’m sure all of us remember last week, when our portfolios got bent over by trump refusing to rule out a recession. A recession. I don’t think it can be spelled out any clearer to even the passengers of the shortest of buses - Trump does not seem to mind, and in fact is open accepting of recession

[Fig 2.6. Google searches for recession surging](https://preview.redd.it/5xev3p0w3npe1.png?width=2338&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f642682041e45ebcd926105b0be2647892d509)

Another decent indicator of recession is also the number of google searches you see for it - clearly, we're amidst another breakout.

[Fig 2.7. Holy fucking shit](https://preview.redd.it/v6p7emz44npe1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea9eae8a32a16633f308444716a58e680b97de93)

The long and short of it is that it’s not looking good. Crashing consumer expectations, cratering stock prices, manufacturing slowdowns - they all paint the picture of a recession coming up. Thus, with inflation not too bad, I believe that the FED should prioritise bringing back economic growth over keeping inflation down.

# A mispricing in the market

So, given the sorry state of our economy and comparatively better inflation control, you'd expect the market to price the chance of an interest rate cut at 40%, maybe 20%, maybe very low end, 5%. In reality...

1 per cent

According to a popular betting market, there is just a 1% chance Powell will change the interest rate today. Now of course, the betting market does not automatically correspond to what the stock market is thinking - however, any investor that sees an obvious arbitrage opportunity like this would be able to make a 100-fold return against tens of millions of dollars of liquidity if the stock market disagreed, so it seems to me that this accurately reflects the general sentiment.

Here's the most important part of my DD that I want to emphasise. In fact, if there’s any takeaway from my DD, let it be this:

I am **not** telling you Jerome will definitely cut rates tomorrow. In fact, anyone claiming to know for sure what Jerome will do tomorrow either has inside information, is lying, or is grossly misinformed. The first group will never talk to the likes of us, the second group is taking advantage of the likes of us, and the third group belongs among the likes of us. 

No, all my DD hinges upon is the idea that the chance of an interest rate cut is higher than 1%. That’s all you need - the thought that interest rate cuts aren't being priced in correctly, and that’s where any real money is made - mispricings in the market. I personally don’t see how the chance of an interest rate cut is not higher than 5% - if your takeaway from my analysis is that it will be anything above 1%, you too believe, there is a mispricing in the market, and can profit from purchasing TLT. 

So this begs the question of why there's a market mispricing

# Why is there a mispricing / “But you’re forgetting about…”

There are a couple ideas that people can bring up to suggest why interest rate cuts are unlikely - I’ll try and cover the main ones and deliver a rebuttal on all of them.

Firstly, there’s concern of inflation from Trump’s tariffs. This is not unfounded - tariffs are inflationary, and perhaps the worry of inflation is too great to cut rates. Firstly, I’d like to point out that many of Trump’s other policies are deflationary: deregulation and government spending cuts are both deflationary, and I don’t think we truly realise how likely “tail-end events” like cutting half of military spending is with an unpredictable guy like Trump - he’s discussed it before. Secondly, Jerome Powell himself has stated, at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business on March 7th, that tariffs may cause a one off price hike, but that “longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2% inflation goal”. A one-off rise in inflation will not need to be adjusted for - as Powell correctly ascertains, policies should only deal with persistent inflation.

Secondly, some will mention that Powell himself has said before that it is not in a hurry to cut interest rates. I will point out that these quotes are all from before March 10th, before Trump refused to rule out the chance of a recession, before the stock market plummeted and lost trillions of dollars, and before we saw consumer confidence sour so drastically. The situation has changed, and Powell is now much more likely to slash rates.

Finally, the previous point already alludes to this, but one idea is that there’s a conflict between Trump and Powell, in the way that Trump is almost trying to cause economic panic to force Powell into lowering interest rates. People will have you believe that big J, in an attempt to win this dick-swinging contest, will refuse to back down and keep interest rates constant. Maybe, maybe, but what's more important than winning the measuring contest is preventing the ruin that will come to millions if we fail to cushion economic downturn. Jerome does not want to be the guy who failed to do enough and saw America go through a recession or worse. In fact, I’ll go so far as to say the opposite - I think Powell is likely to fold now due to his past expereince. Many criticisms have been levelled against the man on account of the fact that he didn’t hike rates early enough in 2021, which led to out-of-control inflation. I think that it’s likely that he has learned from this mistake, and I’d err on him acting sooner rather than later on cutting rates.

Most important to keep in mind however, is that maybe you still have doubts about if Jerome is likely to cut interest rates. Keep in mind - we’re not asking if it’s more likely he’ll cut rates or keep them the same. We’re asking if the market is mispriced - if the chance he’ll cut rates is higher than 1%. Any bit of edge is a bullish indication for TLT.

# Ok, I think the chance of a cut is higher than 1%. How do I make money off that

Minimising risk. It's arguably the one of the core tenets of the stock market - the idea of a net worth rising in a safe and predictable straight line is tantalising to all but the most degenerate regard. It's why so many rich people are willing to take a below-market return from a hedge fund - there's a team of brilliant Asian quants out there who, instead of curing cancer or perfecting interplanetary travel, are creating the most ridiculous and incomprehensible financial products to tame risky and volatile assets into neat little beta neutral, uncorrelated returns that beat the risk free rate by half a percent, all for the price of a 2/20 fee structure. There's money to be made in lowering risk.

However, you’re in the wrong subreddit if you’re that brilliant Asian quant. As such, we’ll be doing the opposite - taking the safest investment in the world - US treasury bonds, and jacking it up to the tits in leverage to increase risk, in return for enlarged profits.

Firstly, treasury bonds are the asset of choice because I think that they will have the largest quick movement due to this mispricing in the market. Stock markets react unpredictably to interest rate movements - bonds do not. For those who don’t know, when interest rates fall, all new government bonds issued have lower coupon rates. As such, the old government bonds, with comparatively higher coupon rates, rise in value. This is why “government bonds rise in value when rates are cut, and vice versa”. This is even more so for long-term treasury bonds compared to short-term bills - since the coupon is paid out many more times, the rise in value is exaggerated too.

The liquid variety for long-term treasury bonds is the TLT, an ETF that tracks the bond price. Not only is the liquidity a plus, but the asset being an ETF allows you to buy options on it, letting you purchase different calls until you are sufficiently leveraged for your personal risk tolerance.

Unfortunately, I’m a broke ass college student who has an evil, satanic, institutional broker that doesn't allow me to buy options. So, I’ve spent about half my money on TLT shares. 

[My 50 shares of TLT](https://preview.redd.it/tbh4scdn6npe1.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=82ee7bedc1831d8ef90a20c15b062fcedfd5121a)

# What Next

Now, of course, I don’t know for sure if Jerome will cut rates. Here are my rough plans based on what happens next:

1. Rates get cut:

I’d expect TLT to rise sharply, due to the market not expecting this cut. Happy days. Probably sell and throw the money into a global fund, or maybe hold onto the position, anticipating more cuts throughout the year.

2. Rates don’t move:

Then in this case, TLT probably won’t move significantly, since the market is pretty much expecting this outcome. I’d probably hold onto my position a bit longer, since if he’s not cutting now, he needs to cut by May. This would also probably give me a generally bearish attitude on the US economy and stocks - I think this would be cutting rates a little too late. Probably start throwing more of my money into bonds and international markets.

Either way, I think that this mispricing in the market can be capitalised on. Good luck regards!

tl;dr - Due to a weak economy, I think there’s a higher than 1% chance rates will be cut (the market prediction), therefore, the markets have priced TLT too low",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jex13o/tlt_dd/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jex13o/tlt_dd/

**TLDR**: Innovative biotech company that is currently ramping up sales of its new innovative medicine, which is the new standard of care in sickle cell disease. Large pipeline may lead to 50X growth from here according to CEO’s lofty goals. Several catalysts are expected in April/May and June/July timeframe, including updates Q1 earnings (updates on Casgevy sales) and data readouts on clinical programs. Outstanding question: is the healthcare system ready for curative one-time therapies, as compared to daily or weekly treatments.

*My Credentials:* I have a MS in Biotech and wrapping up my MBA in healthcare. I have worked in Pharma business development for a few years now. I have been following CRSP since its IPO in 2018.

*My position:*

[Adding more on dips](https://preview.redd.it/5if8gtja9jpe1.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=308e2ceb065c32bcc0f5a67050baa8e65715c77e)

**Background**

CRSP is a company developing medicine for genetic diseases using CRISPR gene editing technology. The scientists who discovered this technology won the Nobel Prize in 2020. CRSP has one marketed product, Casgvey, that was developed via a collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals to treat sickle cell disease. They have a profit sharing arrangement, which entitles them to 40% of all profits from Casgevy, while Vertex manages the commercialization. This is great because they have a built-up commercial team which has shown success at getting reimbursement from insurance and getting doctors to prescribe expensive treatments.

The CEO says that they hope to be $100B biotech one day!!

\*\*Financials (\*\*As of 3/18/2025)

Market Cap = $3.67B; Enterprise Value = $1.8B

Net Cash = $1.9B

Short interest = 24.7% of the float (significant short squeeze potential)

\~70% Institutional Investors (Smart Money)

They have an average operating expenses of \~$130M/quarter, so absent any revenue from Casgevy we can expect them to have funding to last at least the next three years and by then it is highly likely that there will be significant profits from Casgevy. This means that at the very least the dilution risk very low, which is common among pre-revenue biotech companies and is the main reason why they are often heavily shorted.

**Macro**

Rate cut/growth scare means biotech boom.

**Commercial Success**

The CEO has said that there is tremendous patient interest in the therapy, and more will be convinced as additional long-term safety data is generated. CEO also says that they are currently ramping up approved treatments center - both the number of centers and how many patients each can treat.

Several analysts have projected that Casgevy could reach $1B in sales as of 2026 and reach peak sales of $3.5B in 2030, per typical drug sales ramps. As EOY24 there are 50 patients undergoing the Casgevy therapy process, as more treatment centers continue to open. This therapy costs $2.2M and these 50 patients equate to sales of $110 million, but it is unknown when that will be collected and if that is enough for profit to begin flowing to CRSP. It only takes a few dozen patients to be treated for this therapy to yield serious revenue, for example, that $1B target equates to 450 patients being treated, out of a US patient pool of around 30k, who are healthy enough to receive the treatment and have access through insurance. However, this can’t continue forever and once you treat all the available patients, you are only able to treat this disease at the incidence rate (# of babies born with sickle cell) but remember that if Casgevy treats only half of that 30k patient population, it will have made over $33B.

Recently there has been significant process at negotiating access for this therapy on both Medicare/Medicaid and private insurance companies. The consensus insurance approach is outcomes-based agreements (OBA), which would tie a portion of the payments to how well the treatment provide clinical benefit to patients ([Link](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/cgt)). This is critical in providing access to patients and increasing commercial uptake.

Now let’s take a look at my NPV projections based on the analyst estimates above.

Projected NPV of $6B, considering the enterprise value of $1.8B, this implies upside of \~233% or a share price of \~$132. For reference the average analyst price target is \~$77.

**Assumptions**

**Competitors**

There is one other gene edit therapy in sickle cell develop by BlueBird, but they essentially just went bankrupt and sold to a private equity for pennies [(Press Release Link)](https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bluebird-bio-announces-definitive-agreement-be-acquired-carlyle). Not to mention their therapy also has a black box warning for hematological malignancies, which is the kiss of death for therapies where there is a suitable alternative. Who would want to risk getting cancer?  Their therapy also costs $1M more than Casgevy.

Since traditional medicine aka the previous standard of care only addressed the symptoms of sickle cell, we expect almost no competition from the current market landscape. 

There are likely to be several similar therapies from other gene editing competitor coming to market in the next 3-5 years, but the first-to-market usually secures a solid market share.

**Clinical Pipeline**

CRSP also has a solid extensive pipeline of moderately de-risked assets in development. CEO says that commercial success in Casgevy will fund them to make strategic bets to fill their pipeline with 1-2 new drugs per year.

·      **CTX310; CTX320** = Two candidates in vivo liver editing programs targeting LPA and ANGPTL3, which expects data to be release in 1H 2025 (recent presentations suggest between early April and early May). The CEO stated that they will benefit from economies of scale. The first program in their liver editing platform will cost \~$100M and each subsequent one will only cost $15M to develop because it’s a modular platform.

·      **CTX112; CTX131** = Two allogenic CAR-T cell therapy candidates targeting CD19 and CD70, which expect data to be released in mid-2025 and Q4 2025, respectively. Low COGS on allogenic CAR-Ts make them a very attractive business model, even if clinical data is only OK. AstraZeneca reached paid $1B for EsoBiotec, an allogenic CAR-T platform that is in the clinic. ([Link](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-buy-esobiotec-upto-1-billion-2025-03-17/))

·      **VCTX210; VCTX211** = Two regenerative medicine cell therapy replacement candidates for Type 1 Diabetes, which expects an update in 2H 2025. We should be cautious about expecting much from this because their partner, Vertex, has opted out of ownership and we do not know if that is because they plan to focus on their own cell therapy replacement or if something went wrong in the trial.  CEO seemed upbeat about it in a recent presentation.

It's also important to note that CRSP wholly owns all the clinical programs above, so contrary to Casgevy, they will receive 100% of the profits. Feel free to look at their [pipeline](https://crisprtx.com/pipeline) for more in depth analysis, but that is not the focus of this research.  There are also several pre-clinical programs, but those will materially affect the stock price in my view because they are about *at least* 6 years from revenue generation.

**Risks**

·      Patients may not want to go through the cell depletion conditioning process required for this treatment - it is like chemotherapy.

·      Insurance companies may not want to pay for the high price tag of Casgevy ($2.2M), despite the long term clinical and cost benefits. Developing gene editing medicines is not a validated and proven business model (very different economics from small molecules and biologics)

·      Safety Risks. Unknown new clinical data could come out which suggests that there are risks associated with CRISPR based medicine compared to more novel and targeted gene editing approaches like base editing or prime editing. Not sure what these would be, but it’s definitely possible.

·     Efficacy Risks. Any of the their clinical programs might not generate enough efficacy to beat standard of care (however it is widely accepted that precision medicine companies have significantly higher success rates).

·      Competitors still in the clinic could deliver better data that would be the new standard of care in sickle cell, which limits long term growths for Casgevy

·      Cathy Wood is one of their main investors",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jejb3f/crispr_tx_dd/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jejb3f/crispr_tx_dd/
2025-03-18 23:08:58,Will Bitcoin Burn Everyone This Time?,TrainingAffect4000,3035,"MicroStrategy has accumulated nearly 500,000 BTC, but they are now slowing down their purchases. If they start liquidating strategically, they could crash Bitcoin without anyone noticing until it's too late.

Imagine the perfect play:

They sell slowly OTC to avoid scaring the market.

Meanwhile, they short BTC with leverage to maximize profits.

Once support breaks, they dump everything, triggering liquidations.

Bitcoin crashes below 30k, ETFs see massive outflows, and they cash in billions.


If BTC no longer grows exponentially, MicroStrategy is trapped. They either exit now with a profit or risk imploding with the asset. And if they decide to sell, we could witness the biggest Big Short in crypto history.

Too paranoid or a plausible scenario?

P.S. This strategy is known as ""sell against the box"" — a classic risk management tactic used by institutional investors.
It allows an entity to hedge their long position by shorting the same asset, locking in profits without ever selling directly.

By doing this, MicroStrategy could simply drain the market's volatility, generate liquidity, and accumulate even more BTC — all while maintaining a fully bullish narrative and never letting the public see a single direct sale.

2025-03-18 22:54:27,What to look for in FED meeting tomorrow 3/19,Agitated_Product_404,244,"**Jerome Powell's Speech:** Don't be too concerned with Jerome Powell's speech tomorrow, because it will most likely be a copy of his speech from a week ago at the press conference. The market rallied over 1% on that speech as Jerome Powell tried to calm the markets. Mostly consisted of ""wait and see"" and ""the data is still fine"". The truth is we had a decent CPI and Jobs read for Feb, and PMI and consumer Sentiment were mediocre. The Fed simply cannot make a drastic stance on cuts or the economy this early without sufficient data.

**Dot Plot:** The most important thing to look for in the FOMC meeting tomorrow is the brand new revised dot plot. Every major investment bank along with CME Fed watch has their current predictions on rate cuts for 2025 at 2-3 cuts (leaning more towards 3). If we see the 19 members of the fed come out tomorrow and say they disagree with that, and we are more likely to stay with 2 cuts for 2025, we could see a sharp repricing down, as rate cuts are very bullish for the equities market. (you are going to want to see more dots shift down to the line right above 3.5)

[Dec 2024 Dot Plot](https://preview.redd.it/5nidotlj2jpe1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=4262ada3bd7032b9e81342eebc1ab8f30fdd4151)

**Summary of Economic Projections:** Lastly is if the Fed will project a lower GDP then in there last prediction in December. They currently have it at 2.1% for 2025, which was raised from Sept 2024's prediction of 2.0%. But also note they increased their inflation metrics heavily in December.

https://preview.redd.it/yjiz1afp2jpe1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c35aa479d40f066919285c8272ab43606015ff

Dec 2024 Projections

The last summary of projections was a sharp change to inflation reigniting due to their cuts, but also that GDP and Unemployment would improve slightly as a result. With new fiscal policies causing fears that we wont get those improvement in GDP or Unemployment, it really puts the Fed in a tough place where these new projections for March almost seem certain to be downgrades.

[GDP 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/yc5hpmu42jpe1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6d1932796db56357111549000d6f577c926191b)

The other thing to note is that the 2025 GDP projections have the widest distribution of all their 2025 projections. Meaning that the fed members are the most split or undecided on this decision, and that the new data could potentially really swing those numbers down. Opposed to unemployment where 14 of 19 Fed members all picked 4.3% for 2025, and are less likely to all be swayed or moved.

[Unemployment 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/i3xbsfs82jpe1.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0277eed836fe102e11c728f263d4ce3e0c1d205)

**Summary:** I personally believe we will get sharp adjustments down to GDP and slightly up to unemployment, while inflation will stay close to the same (maybe lowered a little). If this isn't met with the Dot Plot increasing the Fed's stance from 2 to 3 cuts for 2025 (I have no prediction for this as there are so many factors), expect more short term pain in the markets as investment banks downgrade and reprice assets down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jeig6j/what_to_look_for_in_fed_meeting_tomorrow_319/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jeig6j/what_to_look_for_in_fed_meeting_tomorrow_319/

2025-03-18 20:34:54,Could Nvidia's valuation be set to be redefined after GTC?,GrantJohnston624,3,"NVIDIA (NVDA) is basically the big cheese in the GPU and AI computing world. Here's the lowdown:

* **Consumer GPUs**: Think gaming rigs, content creators, and PC enthusiasts.
* **Data Centers & AI**: Powering massive AI workloads, cloud services, and enterprise data centers.
* **Self-Driving & Robotics**: Venturing into autonomous vehicles, robotics, and edge computing.

**Financials: Show Me the Money**

Let's dive into NVIDIA's financials over the past five years. Spoiler: It's been a wild ride.

|Fiscal Year|Revenue ($B)|Net Income ($B)|EPS ($)|Gross Margin (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021|16.7|4.3|1.47|62|
|2022|26.9|9.8|3.37|65|
|2023|27.0|10.2|3.55|66|
|2024|30.0|11.5|4.00|67|
|2025\*|35.0|13.0|4.50|68|

\*2025 numbers are guesstimates, so don't @ me if they're off.

**Breaking It Down:**

* **Revenue**: Climbing like a SpaceX rocket, thanks to data centers and AI.
* **Net Income & EPS**: Also on the up and up, showing they're not just making it rain but also stacking those Benjamins efficiently.
* **Gross Margin**: From 62% to an estimated 68%—that's some serious cheddar, indicating their products are top-shelf.

**Product Highlights: What's Cooking?**

* **Blackwell Ultra Series**: Dropping later this year, these AI chips (B300/GB300) are beefed up with 288GB memory (up from 192GB) and a 50% performance boost. Data centers are drooling.
* **Full-Stack AI Solutions**: NVIDIA's building an AI empire, making it easier for cloud providers and businesses to hop on their bandwagon and save some coin.
* **Self-Driving & Robotics**: They're not just about GPUs; they're diving into autonomous vehicles and robots, keeping things futuristic.

**GTC 2025: The Hype Is Real**

* **Event Deets**: On March 18 in San Jose, NVIDIA's annual GTC shindig is the place to be for devs, investors, and media folks. Expect AI, robotics, data centers, and self-driving car talk, plus the scoop on Blackwell Ultra chips and the next-gen Rubin GPU architecture.
* **Market Vibes**: Tickets are hotter than a summer in Phoenix, but NVDA stock dipped \~1.76% pre-event. Investors might be biting their nails over production and yield concerns.
* **Catalyst Watch**: Analysts say if NVIDIA clears the air on production and performance at GTC, we could see a stock rally. If not, expect some market side-eye until the next earnings drop.

**6-Month Stock Forecast: Crystal Ball Time**

* **Bearish Scenario**: If new products flop or GTC is a snooze, stock might chill around $120.
* **Bullish Scenario**: If GTC delivers and NVIDIA squashes production fears, we could see $150 or more.
* **Overall Range**: Expect NVDA to dance between $120 and $150 in the next six months.

**Investment Take: To the Moon?**

* **Hold & HODL**: Most analysts are saying ""buy"" or ""hold,"" betting on NVIDIA's long-term game in AI, data centers, and self-driving tech.
* **DCA FTW**: Given possible short-term jitters post-GTC, consider dollar-cost averaging. Keep an eye on upcoming earnings and product launches.

**Risk Factors: Watch Your Six**

* **Production & Supply Chain**: If the new chips hit snags, short-term profits could take a hit.
* **Competition**: AMD, Intel, and other up-and-comers aren't sleeping; they want a piece of NVIDIA's pie.
* **Macro & Geopolitical**: Global economic hiccups, trade wars, or export bans could rain on NVIDIA's parade.
* **Tech & Product Risks**: If GTC doesn't wow or new products disappoint, investor enthusiasm might fizzle, leading to stock dips.

**TL;DR**

NVIDIA's killing it in the GPU and AI arena, with solid financials and exciting product launches on deck. GTC 2025 is the next big thing to watch. Short-term, the stock might wobble, but long-term prospects look juicy. Keep an eye on competition and global shenanigans, but overall, NVIDIA seems poised for more win.

2025-03-18 19:16:09,Can Newly Released NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software Save NVIDIA's Stock?,Antonia45Heath,28,"First we need to know what the NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software is for.



The above description comprehensively summarizes the main functions and application scenarios of NVIDIA Dynamo, as well as the revolutionary impact it may have on AI inference and its long-term positive effect on the company’s stock price. Specifically:



Software Functions and Application Scenarios



Intelligent Scheduling and Resource Allocation: Dynamo not only inherits the advantages of the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server but also goes further by dynamically allocating GPU resources to cope with fluctuating inference request volumes, ensuring that each GPU operates at high efficiency even under heavy load.

Optimizing Large Language Model Inference: It adopts a decomposed service strategy, distributing the processing and generation stages of large language models across multiple GPUs, which significantly improves throughput in practical applications. For example, when running the DeepSeek-R1 model on certain rack clusters, the number of tokens generated per GPU can be increased by approximately 30 times.

Multi-Framework Support and Expanded Use Cases: As an open-source software, Dynamo can support various frameworks including PyTorch and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, making it suitable for cloud service providers, data centers, and enterprise AI factories.

Revolutionary Significance



Innovation in Resource Utilization: By leveraging intelligent routing and dynamic allocation, Dynamo can double performance and revenue with the same hardware resources, fundamentally changing traditional inference deployment methods.

Building an Open-Source Ecosystem: Its open-source nature not only promotes standardization and innovation in distributed inference architectures but also fosters collaborative progress across the entire AI industry.

Enhancing Cost Efficiency and Performance: By reducing data transmission and storage costs as well as increasing GPU computational density, the software is expected to make AI services more efficient and cost-competitive.

Potential Impact on NVIDIA’s Stock Price In the long term, Dynamo is expected to help consolidate NVIDIA’s leadership in AI infrastructure, especially as the data center and cloud services segments continue to expand, thereby driving higher revenue and profit growth for the company. Although the market might remain cautious about the immediate results of the new product launch in the short term, the widespread adoption of this technology by more service providers is anticipated to have a positive effect on the stock price.



Why do I think NVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Inference Software will have a positive impact on NVDA's stock price?

Because this software will substantially boost NVIDIA's revenue in data center and cloud services.



From the public earnings data and market expectations, NVIDIA's data center and cloud services business has shown an upward trend in recent years, but it should be noted that the proportion here is subject to quarterly fluctuations, especially in quarters driven by AI demand (e.g., in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, data center revenue once accounted for 90.5%)

[CN.INVESTING.COM](http://CN.INVESTING.COM)

), while the full-year average is much smoother. Estimates based on current public information and analysis:



FY2023: Data center and cloud services business will account for approximately 43% of total annual revenue.

FY2024: The market expects this to rise to around 50% or so, driven by continued strong AI demand.

FY2025: While some quarters (e.g. Q4) are particularly strong, on average for the year, the share of data center and cloud services is expected to stabilize between 50% and 55%.

I kept on adding more money but it never worked and by the end of Feb I was down 10k… 

I had my final 15k left and I made an “educated” gamble on how SPY would react to some upcoming news and when the news dropped I was up from 15->20k within 2 minutes. I figured fuck it let me just hold until 25k but the market immediately corrected and I lost everything.

I’m going to lead off with a few basic ways to play this, what kind of red flags I’ll be looking for, and some background and context in case you’re not familiar with this HIGHLY unusual situation.

First off, there are two securities you can buy here. The first are the common stock: FNMA and FMCC, for each of the companies. You need to think of these as call options with no theta and delta 1. I’m personally weighted heavily towards these since Inauguration but I’ll get more into that momentarily. Then there are the junior preferred shares, each of which correspond to one of the companies and usually share the first few letters: FNMAS, FNMAT, FNMAJ for Fannie, and FMCCH, FMCKJ, and FMCCO for Freddie. 

In case you’ve been living under a rock or are an active subscriber of The Motley Fool, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the two most profitable companies by employee, and have the largest assets on the face of fucking planet. That’s seven and a half TRILLION dollars in assets. They buy up mortgages from banks, dump ‘em together in a various pots called securitizations, and basically print money from the payments. Back in 08, the government made a determination based on secret filings that Fannie and Freddie were super dangerous, and would have to print their earnings directly into the Treasury department instead. At the head of this conservatorship, and controlling Fannie and Freddie is the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Currently, the US Treasury Department owns a million shares of the Senior Preferred Shares (SPS) at a value of around $200 billion. They ALSO own warrants, equal to diluting the common stock by 80%. The Treasury awarded themselves these shares and warrants after forcing Fannie and Freddie to take a loan out on hypothetical losses in 08, and there’s only three men who can do anything about that. Thankfully, they have a raging boner of hatred for the government.

Junior Preferred Shares (JPS) and commons are both available to common investors, but only through the OTC, so Robinhooders are in shambles (again). JPS are more protected but have capped upside; they have a par value (aka a cap in price) of either $25 or $50, and if dividends get turned on again (only after a release, covered below), they get up to 8% of par first, and then commons get the rest. There’s also a fun added bonus round just to make things more complex: JPS and Freddie commons (but not FNMA) will be getting damages awarded after the presiding judge decided to sign off (after waiting TWO years, and yes, you read that right). FMCKJ will be getting something like $3 in damages, and as of 3/17, was trading at $10. 

Then there’s common shares. High risk, ultra high reward. Depending on what kind of scenario plays out, we could see share price hitting anything from sub $2 if you believe somnambulant lawyers, to $34 if you believe Bill Ackman, to price targets that you wouldn’t fucking believe until I lay it all.

Right now, here’s the main events:

Relist: Currently commons and JPS languish in OTC purgatory. 20% pops and drops on zero news, zero halts, and lower liquidity than your mother in her memory care unit. Shambles. Rather than an IPO, the companies can follow a much simpler uplisting procedure to the NYSE This will allow institutions to buy who are restricted from OTC trading, as well as making positions marginable, including OPTIONS. Theoretically, they can uplist at any moment.
Recap: based on arbitrary regulations, Fannie and Freddie have to have some certain amount of money to backstop the loans they guarantee. How much you ask? It entirely depends on who’s in charge? Back when Mark Calabria was running things, they needed like 4.5% of their book as a reserve! Good thing that those capital requirements didn’t stop payments from running straight out of Fannie and Freddie’s wallet into untraceable Treasury accounts! The specific phrase you need to parsing Twitter headlines is “ECRF”, which stands for “Everybody Chill, Release Fannie,” letting you know that if the amount is 1.5%, Fannie will be released within a year (it’s just under the capital threshold). If it’s lower than 1.5%, Fannie can be released IMMEDIATELY. Freddie is a little slower, but he works just as hard you guys, and he won’t be far too far behind. 
Release: dividends get turned back on, justice is restored, and angelic choirs announce the golden age of America.

So let me give a couple of the RED FLAGS for free. If you see these, FLEE commons. 
Warrant Exercise. We know you’ve been trying hard to forget that reminder about your license being suspended, but this is definitely one warrant you can’t escape. Diluting the float by 80% would absolutely murder commons with no real hope of reprieve. Your only saving grace might be that OTC tends to trade headlines a day or two slow. 
SPS conversion. Just like a regular conversion, this one will also have you on your knees begging for mercy. Basically another form of dilution.
“Need for continued study.” You know how when you had that hot band chick over to study, and you kept trying to touch her hand while going over AP Calc homework, but she got angry that you weren’t paying enough attention to what SHE thought was important? This is like that. Without significant internal pressure, government impetus will stop any relist/recap/release movement simply out of being the fact that they’re collectively lazy and stupid. Given that midterms are going to be a distraction for decision makers only 15 months from now, progress needs to be made, and quickly, before GOP control of all three branches is threatened. Specifically, while some of these comments were made by Scott Bessent (now Treasury Secretary) and Bill Pulte (now FHFA Director), that was before they were confirmed, and based on everything I’m seeing, were statements to basically placate the committees. To get released, these companies will need specific and meaningful policy decisions.

Here’s what I’m IMAGINING for green flags. Seriously, there hasn’t been a lot of public statements made about these companies, but I think for good reasons, mainly political.
SPS CANCELLED. There’s several good reasons to believe the Treasury’s stock will just straight go to zero. First, the Treasury has been MORE than paid back on the loans they gave going back to 08; altogether, they got paid $340 billion over a $200 billion loan. This raises serious questions about why the government can simply continue to demand money from organizations it ‘conserves,’ which was one reason why a jury voted 8-0 to give damages in the Fairholme case. The continued existence of SPS brings into question the very notion of property rights in America.
Warrants to be sold. There’s a lot of speculation about what the Treasury would do with the warrants after a recap/relist. A popular theory is that the Treasury could gradually sell these assets off, and allocate the money to whatever pet project. This seems pretty likely, given talk about a Sovereign Wealth Fund, and similar procedures with confiscated bitcoins etc. There’s some interesting dynamics where warrants could be sold to fund a SWF, which funds real estate development, which pumps FnF, raising warrant values higher, etc.
Warrants to be CANCELLED. The ultimate bull case. If this happens, commons will launch to Mars and legends will be made. Some say the “government” would never go for this. I say the government is run by the same man who brought us TRUMPCOIN on Inauguration weekend, and we can’t even know if he has a position since filings on OTC are VOLUNTARY. Sure would be quite an ARTFUL DEAL if the decision maker about FHFA actions just so happened to have a position.

So where are we at with this?
Trump: a man with significant real estate holdings and a desire to eliminate government agencies wholesale.
Bessent: confirmed Treasury Secretary with a desire to privatize everything in sight.
Pulte: confirmed FHFA director, who on the first day, declared himself Chairman of the Board for FnF and cleared house on the board. 
At this point I’m basically just waiting for an announcement. It will probably come from Bessent who will declare something about having made an agreement with Pulte to wind down FHFA, but I wouldn’t put it past Trump to announce an executive order just ending it, a la USAID. There hasn’t been much specifically said, but there is a forest of legal red tape surrounding this thing. While there could be progress made on the legal front (final motion in Fairholme damages was finally dismissed after waiting two years, and the case still isn’t even certified!), this is ultimately a political question and it seems like all the stars have aligned. 

Positions: I've been selling JPS to capture some more volatility out of commons, I plan to rotate around a bit. 

""But you're already up a lot"" dipshit, tell me if it makes any sense for a $3 dividend to trade at $6. 

""You just want exit liquidity"" you just want to be able to breathe through your nose, but that doesn't stop you from buying BABA with less volume on the NYSE than EITHER Fannie or Freddie on the OTC.
