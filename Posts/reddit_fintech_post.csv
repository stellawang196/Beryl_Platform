2025-04-03 12:24:47,"Launched a Free API That Converts Raw Credit Reports to JSON: Unlock Legacy Data for ML, Risk Models & More",creditparsepro,1,"Hello r/fintech!

​If you're looking to enhance your fintech projects with comprehensive credit report data, we offers a robust solution. Our API [creditparsepro.io](https://www.creditparsepro.io/) seamlessly converts fixed-format credit reports from major U.S. bureaus into structured, standardized JSON, unlocking a multitude of opportunities for financial innovation.​ To make testing our product painless, you can sign up for our [free tier](https://buy.stripe.com/5kA4iQ7B42LP3baeV5) with just an Email. Further, for a limited time our **Professional** plan completely [FREE](https://buy.stripe.com/00g7v25sW7256nm8wO).

Credit report analysis generally involves users scrolling an interface that makes it manageable. But have you seen what fixed-format credit reports look like on the backend?  Here is a single tradeline that represents only a fraction of a credit report. Many credit reports are over 10,000 lines long.

    TR01288Q 0202V002WLM P & F CU            I66666                   I2020042620240101V                         051000003817000006587         034M000000242                                    US            00         2024010105                                                        00      

If you want to start automating decisioning and training machine learning models on this data you need it in a structured format. Below you will see just a few of our fields in the structured join-format JSON:

        {
          ""account_number"": ""66666"",
          ""close_date"": """",
          ""credit_limit_amount"": 0,

          ""is_open"": ""1"",
          ""last_payment_date"": """",
          ""maximum_delinquency_amount"": 0,

          },

You can expect MUCH more data and it doesn't matter if you are running TransUnion or Experian (Equifax in the future) you will get the same output format across bureaus.

You can run an example for yourself on our [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/34164250/2sA3BgBFus) no account needed. Just follow the link and scroll down to **v1/parse-report.**

**Key Features:**

* **Free Plan with Full Functionality:** Experience all features without limitations.
* **Broad Bureau Compatibility:** Our API supports various formats, including TransUnion's TU4.0 and TU4.1 FFR, and Experian's ARF, facilitating seamless integration across different data sources.
* **Unified Output Format:** Regardless of bureau and version/type all data returned will be in the same JSON structure so downstream systems will not need dynamic programming.

**Unlock the Potential of your Credit Data**

Many financial institutions operate legacy systems that generate or store vast amounts of historical credit report data in unstructured formats. Many of the common Loan Origination Systems (LOS) are notorious for this. By transforming this data into structured JSON we enable:

* **Credit Risk Modeling:** Develop more accurate risk assessments using structured data.
* **Automated Underwriting:** Streamline decision-making processes with reliable data inputs.
* **Fraud Prevention & Detection:** Enhance security measures by analyzing structured credit information.
* **Process Automation:** Reduce manual interventions and increase operational efficiency.
* **Enhanced Data Visualization & Reporting:** Gain clearer insights through improved data presentation.

**Getting Started is Simple:**

1. **Choose a Plan:** Select from our free (no credit card required) or paid subscriptions to suit your needs.
2. **Obtain your API Key:** Receive your unique key via email upon registration.
3. **Explore Documentation:** Access our comprehensive guides on [GitHub](https://github.com/granum-tech/creditparsepro/blob/main/docs/documentation.md) and [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/34164250/2sA3BgBFus) to help integrate seamlessly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1jqh1is/launched_a_free_api_that_converts_raw_credit/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1jqh1is/launched_a_free_api_that_converts_raw_credit/

I’m working on a tool to help finance professionals who regularly work with SEC filings and earnings call transcripts. The idea is to make it much faster to:
	•	Summarize key information from filings
	•	Detect changes between periods
	•	Ask direct questions and get sourced answers
	•	Spot missing or unusual disclosures (like missing share counts or hidden adjustments)

At this stage, I’m not selling anything — just trying to learn from people who regularly deal with filings.

If you are:
	•	An analyst
	•	Portfolio manager
	•	Equity researcher
	•	Accountant or auditor
	•	Financial journalist
	•	Or anyone who spends hours on filings

I’d love to know:
	1.	What’s the most tedious or frustrating part of working with SEC filings?
	2.	What would actually save you time or make the process less painful?

Thanks in advance. If you’d like, I’m also happy to share a prototype once ready.

Hey everyone, I’m the creator of “F,” a system designed to tackle P2P fraud as a social issue, not just a tech problem, thought it’s tech heavy. F uses unique trust mechanics, education, and a fee-funded “X” (hidden) with the goal to cut fraud by 50%, saving $1B at $1T volume while generating $750M-$900M in revenue. It also can fund $44M in ESG education for 80M users at scale, creating a new approach to fraud prevention that aligns with a charitable cause as well.  

This could be a game-changer for large P2P platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App, which face 28% of FTC scam reports, as well as smaller players like Remitly or Prosper. It could also be Craigslist 2.0 for a visionary VC. I’m open to feedback and would love to connect with real movers to enhance my prospects and improve the idea, possibly building the MVP, etc. What do you think? Would you like to help?

We’re experimenting with a new lending model:  
Users can borrow against their high-value items (watches, electronics, bags, etc.) without ever giving them up. The assets stay with the borrower.

The core stack:

* Machine learning for valuation
* Soft credit check for borrower screening
* Loans up to $5K/item at 18–22% APR
* P2P lending model on the backend, offering 8–10% to backers

We’re live in NYC and focused on two core problems:

1. Giving non-traditional borrowers access to credit
2. Creating safer P2P lending opportunities using real-world collateral

Would love feedback on the model — especially from other fintech folks who’ve built or funded lending platforms.

My issue is summaries can be very vague and even with careful prompting, the LLM model does not always extract details that may be important to the overall analysis of investment. So I was thinking of adding a notes capability where users, if interested, would be able to dig deeper into concepts and key words they find in the text from across other sources of data.

* Are there existing solutions or APIs that could help us reduce fees without reinventing the wheel?

2025-03-22 22:57:53,Question regarding Amazon Pay and Stripe,Thin_Ad_8356,1,"Hey, I am trying to buy something from an online website that is not shady but not reputable. The checkout page took me to what supposedly is Stripe (I say supposedly because you never know it could be a dummy site). I did not want to directly put my card into this website so I pressed the amazon pay button. It took me to the legitimate Amazon pay website because I was able to sign out and then sign in with my Amazon credentials. When I went to finalize my purchase with my credit card over Amazon Pay two things stuck out at me.

""Your payment method will be saved for future purchases with this merchant"" and ""You allow the merchant to charge future purchases to your saved payment method"". My concern regarding the first quote is that I do NOT want Amazon to give my credit card number to the merchant nor stripe (as I don't completely trust thatit'ss not a dummy). Regarding the second quote, I am signing up for a monthly subscription that I don't know if I will be able to easily cancel from the seller's site.

Can II turn off recurring payments from Amazon's side or at least disable my saved payment method from the seller's point of view? Of course, this point would be muted if Amazon gave my credit card information directly to the seller. If it helps, I always remove my saved payment method after every purchase I make with Amazon.

Also, is [https://apay-us.amazon.com/](https://apay-us.amazon.com/)

 the legitimate URL for amazon pay and [https://checkout.stripe.com/](https://checkout.stripe.com/) the legit URL for stripe?

Hi everyone,

I’m thinking of leaving ""Sparkasse"" (Germany) to a ""modern"" bank like Trade Republic, N26, etc.,

But I have concerns about their approach to two-factor authentication. Unlike traditional banks that offer separate authentication methods (e.g., TAN via chip card with external device), these fintechs rely on a single device—typically a smartphone—for both banking and authentication.

To mitigate this risk, I’m thinking about using a second phone with a separate SIM card only for receiving authentication codes (SMS TANs), while keeping my main smartphone for actual banking transactions.

Would this setup improve security, or are there still significant risks I should be aware of?

2025-03-20 14:12:46,Are We Entering a Wave of Fintechs Buying Banks?,SleuthPD,0,"Two recent announcements—SmartBiz Loans' purchase of Centrust Bank in Illinois and U.K.-based OakNorth's agreement to buy Michigan's Community Unity Bank—highlight an ongoing push by digital banks and fintechs to gain traction in the U.S. banking sector.

🔹 SmartBiz Loans (Billfloat) had to wait nearly a year to gain BHC approval from the Fed, underscoring the regulatory scrutiny fintech-bank deals have faced in recent years. The OCC then approved changing Centrust's business model to let the buyer offer small-business lending nationwide.

🔹 OakNorth had already laid the groundwork for U.S. expansion, and it secured regulatory approval in August to open a New York representative office. Its acquisition of a relatively young bank signals that digital platforms remain eager to gain charters, establish traditional banking footholds, and find faster routes to scale.

💡 Why Are More Fintechs Looking to Buy Banks? 

Several factors could drive more deals like these in the months ahead:

✔️ **Pressure on BaaS Partnerships**: Regulatory scrutiny on sponsor banks and Banking-as-a-Service models could force fintechs to explore bank ownership.

✔️ **Faster Time-to-Market**: A bank charter unlocks greater flexibility, letting fintechs launch deposit products, lending services, and other offerings without relying on third-party partners.

✔️ **Small Banks Mulling Exits**: Rising compliance costs and margin pressure may push more community banks to view a sale as the best path forward.

✔️ **Shifting Regulatory Environment**: Signals from the White House suggest a potential easing of regulatory headwinds, which could clear the way for more nontraditional bank deals.

📌 Will Regulatory Approvals Become Easier?

Some industry observers expect merger approvals to accelerate as approval processes become more clearly defined. We're already seeing signs of regulatory optimism in the form of ILC applications from General Motors, Stellantis, and OneMain Financial. This suggests that fintechs, neobanks, and even non-financial companies could pursue more acquisitions to gain direct access to banking infrastructure.

🚨 Will we see a surge in fintech-bank deals, or will regulatory bottlenecks continue to curb enthusiasm?

* Supports Canadian and US banks + investment platforms
* Provides read-only financial data securely
* Has a developer-friendly API with good documentation
* Offers flexible pricing for startups

2. What are the major costs incurred when a transaction is done? My understanding is that aggregators like PhonePe incur marketing, tech costs. Banks on both ends also incur tech costs. I also read somewhere that NPCI also charges some money to participating banks for every transaction.

Hi everyone,

I’m a computer engineering student in my final year, and I’m currently doing a long-term internship at a small company. In this role, I mostly work with Nortel-era log files, troubleshooting issues like failed auto backups, and receiving mentorship in my CCNA journey. This experience has allowed me to build a strong foundation in computer networks as I work toward certification. Since my position is fully remote, I sometimes feel isolated in my learning and have found myself losing focus a bit.

Recently, an opportunity has come up for an internship at a national bank in their Network Department. However, due to some policies, I’m not entirely sure what their work entails. I’ve heard from some advisors that banks may still use older technologies, which could limit my experience if I decide to transition to another role or company in the future.

The proposed virtual card usage model is as follows:  
  
\- Subscribers will receive virtual cards for payment purposes.

  
\- These virtual cards can be added to their Apple or Google Pay wallets for convenient checkout integration. Alternatively, they can manually input card details at checkouts.

  
\- The virtual card will remain locked until the subscriber manually indicates their intention to make a purchase (e.g., for cupcake/bakery-related products where Visa is accepted). The card will automatically lock every 15 minutes.

  
\- Upon card unlocking, the subscriber will input the transaction amount. Funds will be transferred from my company’s account to the subscriber’s virtual card to cover the transaction.

  
\- Upon purchase confirmation, the subscriber will upload a picture of the transaction receipt.

  
\- The funds will be sourced from the subscriber’s monthly or annual subscription, which covers 50% of a transaction, up to $2.50 per day. Subscribers will be responsible for the remaining balance for transactions exceeding this limit.

- What’s Affirm’s HM round like for TAMs? STAR-heavy?
- Are they heavy on the technical side or more focused on client handling experience?
- Do they grill you on past projects/metrics (e.g., escalations, NPS, retention)?
- How much do they care about fintech/payments domain knowledge vs. general TAM skills?
- Trying to gauge whether they'll dig into my past client escalation experience, technical troubleshooting approaches, or just general fit. Any red flags to avoid?

I'm so interested to know;

* What’s your process for client risk assessments right now? Manual, automated, mix of both?
* Do you feel like existing risk models actually capture real threats, or are they just a box-ticking exercise?

However that v1 model was pretty naive (trained using word tokens and random forest classifier), it has relative ""low"" accuracy. As we have a passion to build the best accurate categorization API, we have invested quite some time using the most advanced language model and embeddings technology to train the V2 model, in our test, it hugely improved the accuracy. 

I would like to share it here with you, please try it out if you find it useful for your product.

In V2, here are some notable changes:

1. Use the most advanced technology to train the neural net model.
2. Fine-grained category in return. (130+ categories vs 30+ categories in V1)
3. Input requires transaction objects (name, merchant, amount) rather than just names.

merchant, amount are optional but recommended to include for better accuracy.

I’ve been thinking about one specific problem—**managing M-Pesa payments efficiently**. Many people forget to send payments on time, businesses struggle with bulk disbursements, and tracking expenses isn’t easy.

So I’m exploring an idea: **S-Pesa** – a payment scheduling app for M-Pesa users with features like:  
✅ **Scheduled Payments** – Set one-time or recurring payments with reminders.  
✅ **Bulk Payments** – Upload a CSV file to send money to multiple people at once.  
✅ **Smart Notifications** – Alerts for upcoming payments, failed transactions, and low balances.  
✅ **Dashboard & Analytics** – Track spending trends and upcoming bills.

Would this be useful to you? Do you think it solves a real problem, or are M-Pesa and existing fintech solutions already enough? I’d love to hear your thoughts!

2025-02-19 01:34:07,Product Management career question,Scared-Currency7,1,"Hi 

Looking for product management career advice and feedback.

**Background**: So, I have a top MBA and work in the strategy team of a financial services player in the USA. Strategy work has been interesting but feels like there's no implementation / shipping + I want to work at the intersection of business and technology + want to maximize compensation -> this lands me on pivoting to product management as a career.



**Aim**: Ideally, I would like to do product management at a firm that is in a passion area like music streaming (Spotify etc.) or has high compensation (Big tech, growth stage pre IPO companies).



**The plan to get there**: Realizing I can't make the jump directly, the path of least resistance seems to be to stick with my current firm and pivot internally to product management, learn the skills and then find a role in passion or high comp company in 1-2 years, ideally after having been promoted one level internally as well.



**The meat of the matter:**

In the financial services firm I'm at, there seem to be different types of product managers -> the business type and the tech/digital type.



The business ones handle the core products (think banking products, lending, cards) and don't do traditional big tech product management.



The tech/digital ones are spread out all over. Some of them work on the consumer facing app website while others work on the digital delivery of the said banking products, while others work on internal tools. 



The business PMs also seem more central to the organization (i.e. on the critical path).



What type of product team should I aim to join? What is more lucrative from a career POV in the long term?



My gut says that going tech/digital PM with current firm for a few years -> transition into passion / high comp product firm is the way to go if I am looking for a legit PM career whereas if I want to stick with this firm and grow, I should pursue a business PM career.



Thoughts? Would love your feedback on the reasoning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1istfu3/product_management_career_question/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1istfu3/product_management_career_question/

Need your advices.

As a consultant/contractor, I've been working with several Canadian banks/fintech companies over the last decade. I've noticed they're struggling with some problems, around application processing / onboarding / automations. 

Most are using a mix of:

* Email chains for document collection
* Various forms - Google, Type, Paper, PDF 
* Manual work with multiple internal/external systems

As a techy with over 24yrs, I couldn't stop my itch. And started to build a B2B solution named [Consen.co](http://Consen.co) with: 

* Visual workflow builder (drag-and-drop) with integrations and few other automations support
* Application builder (json directed forms, Files upload etc.)
* Document generation from templates
* Task automation & routing for employees/agents
* Audit trails and rule-engine for compliance (was thinking about regulated domains)
* Integration capabilities (API/Webhooks)
* Multiple web fronts (Customer portal, admin console etc.)



Now, I know I broke all the startup best advices.- validate first, niche-down, get paying customers before you build it etc etc.

But... now I think it's really an usable solution. From my experience, I know it'll be hard to get Financial businesses onboard. :-)

Most existing converters struggled with multi-column layouts, tables, figures, and scanned content. So, we took a shot at building our own solution.

Doctly has come a long way in converting  PDFs. It excels at handling scanned documents, multi-column layouts, tables, charts, and even ruled paper used for testimonies. We use “intelligent routing” to select the best model for each page, ensuring high accuracy.

2025-02-16 03:40:20,How do fintech innovators find collaborators for their projects? Are existing tools enough?,ManagerCompetitive77,4,"Hey fintech community!

As someone fascinated by the intersection of finance and technology, I’ve been thinking about how fintech innovators—whether solo developers, small teams, or startups—find collaborators to bring their ideas to life. Whether it’s building a payment gateway, creating a blockchain solution, or developing a personal finance app, collaboration is key—but finding the *right* person can be a challenge.

From what I’ve seen, most people rely on platforms like **LinkedIn** , **Upwork** , or niche communities on **Discord/Slack** . Others attend hackathons, fintech meetups, or lean on personal networks. While these methods work to some extent, they often feel clunky or incomplete when it comes to finding someone who’s truly aligned with your vision—especially in a specialized field like fintech.

So here’s what I’m curious about:

1. **Are existing tools effective for finding collaborators in fintech?**
   * LinkedIn is great for professional networking, but does it really help you find someone with the specific technical or financial expertise needed for a fintech project?
   * Upwork is awesome for hiring freelancers, but how well does it work for long-term partnerships or equity-based collaborations in fintech?
2. **What’s missing in the current landscape?**
   * Is there a gap in how these platforms facilitate trust, skill-matching, or shared goals in the fintech space?
   * Would features like verified credentials (e.g., certifications in blockchain, AI, or finance), project showcases, or collaboration-specific filters make a difference?
3. **Would you use a platform designed specifically for fintech collaboration?** Imagine a tool built to connect fintech innovators with complementary skills—developers, data scientists, financial analysts, compliance experts—who are looking to team up on shared ideas. It could include:
   * Skill-based matching tailored to fintech (e.g., blockchain development, regulatory tech, AI in finance)
   * A showcase for past projects or contributions (like a portfolio for fintech professionals)
   * Built-in communication tools to vet potential collaborators

Do you think this kind of platform would solve a real pain point, or do existing tools already cover this need?

I’d love to hear your thoughts—especially if you’ve faced challenges in finding collaborators for fintech projects or have ideas for features that could make the process smoother. Any feedback or personal experiences would be super valuable!

Thanks in advance for sharing your insights. Looking forward to the discussion!

Are large payments companies just able to absorb the cost of compliance and data services, in order to create reliance on there services e.g., developer tools, issuing, banking etc.? Therefore smaller companies are over shadowed, or do not attempt to compete?

* **Accuracy:** Have you found one to be more accurate than the other in terms of pulling and categorizing financial data?
* **Reliability:** How often do you experience account disconnections or errors? Do certain institutions have more frequent connection issues with one provider versus another? *\*cough\* \*cough\** *Fidelity*

I come from a product design/management background and I just started my research in the compliance field (GRC, but specifically in the finance industry) recently and am wondering if it is worth the shot to get into it. If you work in compliance, risk, or adjacent roles, I’d love to hear from you.

1. What are your role and day-to-day responsibilities? How would you describe it?
2. Who owns the process? Is it an internal process for you or do you have external stakeholders involved just as well (like auditors or 3P firms)?
3. How do you navigate through the many overlapping and contradictory frameworks? (to those operating in many jurisdictions and geographies this seems to me like a very convoluted thing to handle)
4. What do you love about it? What do you hate the most? 
5. Do the developers *hate* you? (If there are any devs in the subreddit you're very welcome to vent out or provide another frame of reference to the discussion) – I have a few DevOps friends complaining about the regulatory scrutiny and back-and-forth.
6. How did you get into it? Do you feel it is/was worth it?

2025-02-13 05:09:46,What Will Money Look Like in the Future?,iqamars,0,"
Will banks still control financial transactions? Will physical wallets become obsolete? Will AI and blockchain create a  #financialsystem where intermediaries are no longer needed?

The financial landscape is shifting faster than ever. Traditional models are being challenged by digital currencies, AI-powered financial decisions, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Those who adapt will thrive—those who ignore these shifts risk being left behind.

Having spent years at the forefront of #FinTech, collaborating with global networks like Visa and Mastercard, and local/international Banks, I’ve witnessed how financial systems evolve. Businesses are racing to integrate AI into lending decisions, #blockchain is reducing fraud and settlement times, and central banks are exploring digital currencies. But with progress comes complexity. 

How do businesses and professionals prepare for this new era?

Here are three key forces shaping the future of finance:

- The AI-Driven Financial Ecosystem – AI is making lending decisions, predicting market trends, and detecting fraud in milliseconds.
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi) vs. Traditional Banking – DeFi is removing intermediaries, and allowing direct peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and investing. 
- The Rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) – Governments are taking digital currencies seriously. 

These shifts are not distant possibilities, they are happening now. The question is: Are we ready for the financial systems of the future?

I’ve spent years analyzing these changes and will be sharing deeper insights in the coming weeks—including something I’ve been working on behind the scenes that consolidates these lessons into a practical guide. For now, I’d love to hear your thoughts. 

What do you think will shape the future of finance over the next decade?

Last Friday, my account suddenly got restricted, and they told me I needed to do a video call verification. I did the call, and everything went fine. They told me that since it was Friday, I’d have to wait until Monday for my account to be restored.

Monday came and went – no update, no access to my money. Then, on Tuesday at 5 PM, I received an email saying my account was closed because my ID was “not valid.” Mind you, this is a government-issued ID, the same one I used when signing up. If Paysera operates like this, I’d rather not be a customer—but the problem is, ALL my money is stuck in the account.

I trusted Paysera, and this is how they treat customers. Now they send me an email asking where to send my money, only to later tell me the transfer will take 2 weeks or even longer! I am a single father with a 6-month-old baby, I’m renovating my home, and I can’t even access MY hard-earned money. This is beyond ridiculous.

When you call them to explain your situation, their response is: “You agreed to our terms, this is your problem.” They talk about MY money as if THEY earned it. Unbelievable.

Automating such insurance documents is truly a challenge. One reason is the comparatively limited number of documents available in non-English languages to train automation platforms such as RPA, OCR, and IDP. Due to this, most document automation vendors don’t provide multilingual support. One approach is to replicate different variations of the available documents and use that data to train the systems for better results. However, for such use cases, a significant amount of manual effort is involved in the process, as it requires a trial-and-error approach, correcting each mistake the system makes until it is properly trained. Consequently, the number of vendors offering multilingual support for documents is quite limited.

* Pricing isn't always transparent
* Feature comparisons are time-consuming

* What information is crucial for decision-making?
* Which comparison features would be most valuable?
* What gateways should we add next?
* How to make technical specifications more useful?

2025-02-11 04:34:31,How I Conquered My Credit Card Debt and Built a Free App to Help Others,IncreaseImaginary214,1,"Hey r/fintech community,

I wanted to share my personal journey in hopes it might help or inspire some of you. I’m Sourabh—the Founder of CreditConnect. A few years ago, I was drowning in credit card debt, juggling multiple cards, and barely making minimum payments. Every financial app I tried fell short of actually helping me get out of debt in a clear, strategic way.

**My Turning Point**

Desperate for a solution, I took a deep dive into my spending patterns, interest rates, and payment timelines. Combining data analytics with common-sense budgeting, I developed a personal algorithm that prioritized which cards to pay off first. Amazingly, I saw my debt shrink significantly in just a few months, and my credit score climbed higher than ever.

Becoming the “Credit Specialist”

Friends noticed how quickly I improved my situation and started asking for help with their own credit cards. It became clear that millions of people share the same struggles I’d faced. That realization was the spark for building something bigger.

**The Birth of CreditConnect**

I decided to turn my approach into an app—[CreditConnect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ccai/id6502308971)—that anyone can use (currently on iOS, with Android in development). Here’s what it does:

**Demystifies Credit Card Debt** – Uses my proven algorithm to show exactly where your money should go first.

**Provides Personalized Insights** – Helps you see spending patterns and make more informed decisions.

**Offers a Virtual Assistant** – Trained on all things credit card-related to help you navigate which card is best for your needs.

And the best part: CreditConnect is completely free—no hidden fees or premium versions.

**Security & Privacy**

I know security and privacy are huge concerns for any financial app. That’s why CreditConnect integrates with Plaid, an industry-leading service used by top fintech companies to securely connect bank accounts. All your data is encrypted, and we never sell or share your personal information with third parties. I wanted to make a tool that helps people get out of debt without compromising their trust.

**Lessons I Learned**

**Track Everything:** Knowledge is power. Once I saw where every dollar was going, I could prioritize effectively.

**Focus on Interest Rates First:** It’s one of the fastest ways to reduce debt.

**Talk About Money:** Friends, family, or forums like this can offer moral support (and sometimes real-world tips).

**Consistency is Key:** Even small extra payments add up over time if you stick to them.

**Give It a Try**

If you’re on iOS, feel free to [download CreditConnect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ccai/id6502308971) and let me know what you think! It’s 100% free, and I genuinely hope it can help anyone feeling as stuck as I once did. If you’re on Android, sit tight—the app is in development, and I’ll share updates soon.

I’m here to answer any questions, whether it’s about the strategies that worked for me, the virtual assistant feature, or how I built the app. We’re all on this journey together!

**TL;DR:**

I overcame significant credit card debt using a strategy I developed myself. That method turned into CreditConnect—a free, secure iOS app that breaks down debt repayment, offers personalized insights, and includes a virtual assistant to help you choose the right credit card. We use Plaid to keep your financial data secure, and we never sell or share your personal information. Android version is on the way!

2025-02-09 04:19:15,How common are financial ledger issues?,DuckJellyfish,5,"I used to run a marketplace where we needed to track user balances so that balances accurately reflected the money we owed the users. 

We used two companies to manage our ledgers and payouts. ""Company1"" was an API/cloud service that managed the credit card gateway and tracked transactions and user balances. We also used ""Company2"" which housed our funds and had an API to initiate the user payouts. Both companies would make costly mistakes that shocked me.

Company1 would completely miscalculate the ledger. So, for example, when users were owed $60k in one day, the company accidentally put $120k total in the ledger because they double counted the daily batch. This is just one example of the many types of ledger mistakes they made. I had weekly and semi-weekly emergencies like this with them. 

Company2 would make mistakes where we'd send them an API request to pay out a user. The API would return a 400 error, so we'd retry multiple times. Then the company would email us saying the 400 response was wrong; the payments were, in actuality, successful, and they paid the user three times. Again, this mistake is only one example of the daily issues we had.

I'm not sure if I should name the companies because maybe we had an unusual situation. I never had these types of issues with Stripe, though Stripe has its fair share of issues, but I couldn't use them for this project.  
  
Is it common to have ledger issues like this? I feel like these are major errors that shouldn't happen, and could have easily been prevented with better code. But the issues were so prevalent with both companies that it felt like it must be normal. It makes me so nervous to run any company with payouts. How do you ensure these mistakes don't happen?

2025-02-08 17:08:15,"Fintech Needs AI, But Not Like This 💸🤖",Pale-Show-2469,1,"I’ve been working in ML for a while, and the more I look at fintech, the more it feels like a perfect use case for AI done right. But instead, I keep seeing companies defaulting to LLMs for problems where they make zero sense.

Risk scoring? Fraud detection? Credit underwriting? These are structured data problems. But somehow, companies are throwing massive language models at them, burning compute and racking up cloud bills for tasks that could be handled by smaller, faster, and more explainable models.

One of the biggest challenges in fintech is data availability. You can’t just take customer transactions or loan applications and dump them into a model—privacy laws, compliance, and data scarcity make training difficult. That’s why synthetic data generation could be a game-changer. If we can generate high-quality synthetic datasets that reflect real-world financial patterns, AI in fintech becomes way more accessible—startups could train models without needing huge proprietary datasets, and companies could test AI strategies without compliance nightmares.

That’s why my co-founder and I built [smolmodels](https://github.com/plexe-ai/smolmodels)—an open-source tool that lets you generate lightweight, task-specific AI models fast, even with synthetic data.

The fact that fintech is still struggling with AI adoption makes no sense to me. Regulatory concerns, data availability, and deployment complexity shouldn’t be blockers. AI models don’t need to be massive to be useful—they need to be accurate, interpretable, and efficient.

2025-02-08 15:28:50,P2P Lending Is Broken – I Built a Solution That Affects CIBIL Score,Mundane-Device7539,2,"**The biggest issue in P2P lending? No real accountability.** Borrowers take loans and sometimes **disappear**, leaving lenders with **zero security**. Why? Because there’s no real consequence for defaulting.

So, I built something different—a P2P lending app where **loan repayments directly impact the borrower’s CIBIL score**. This ensures **real trust and accountability** in personal lending.

💡 **Why This Is Needed:**

* Traditional P2P lending is risky—borrowers can vanish
* Lenders hesitate to trust unknown borrowers
* A system is needed where **borrowers feel the responsibility to repay**

🚀 **How It Works:**

1. **One-time KYC during signup** for security
2. **Lend/borrow only within trusted networks** (friends, family, verified users)
3. **Set clear loan terms** (amount, tenure, interest)
4. **Real-time tracking of repayments**
5. **Missed payments affect CIBIL score**, ensuring true financial responsibility

🎁 **Extra Features:**

* **Scan & pay, UPI transfers, bill payments**
* **A shop where users earn coins for transactions**

🔍 **The Big Picture:**  
If P2P lending is backed by **credit score accountability**, more people would lend safely, and borrowers would take loans seriously.

I’ve designed and structured this product, focusing on solving the trust issue in P2P lending. Development is the next step, and I’d love to hear insights from the community. Would this solve trust issues in lending? Let’s discuss!

2025-02-06 01:58:59,Transaction classification challenges and solutions,theC4T,6,"Hey all, thought I'd make a quick post outlining some of the challenges I've had to overcome / am still stumped on when it comes to classifying transactions.

The reason I started this project was I didn't want to manually categorize my transactions anymore, wanted greater visibility into my business spend, and found that most budgeting apps do really poorly with categorization. around ~80% of transactions were off for most of them.

So I've been building this system to categorize them myself and I wanted to see what you think about the challenges I've faced with it and the solutions I've come up with.


# 1. Classification Algos

I found most open source classification algos did a good job with larger vendors (Amazon, Spotify ... ) but failed with things like a local grocery store.

So I used a combined system of a classical classification algo for the larger vendors and for the more niche vendors I've leveraged an LLM + web searching to augment the transaction with relevant data for it's classification.

This brought the number of correct classifications up to 90-95% correct.

# 2. Transactions are too low resolution

How can you categorize a place a transaction at Walmart or Costco? Is it grocery, pharmacy, department store, ... ?

Transactions simply don't have enough information sometimes.

Most of the time it's pretty 1:1 - Starbucks == Coffee

but for cases like these, I think the only solution is to take pictures of receipts.

However, as I work to turn this into something that other people can use - the UX just doesn't make sense for most people. Taking a picture of your receipt is possibly too cumbersome for most.

# 3. Search data

I've opted to use google custom search for getting the data to classify the vendor better.

but there's a few other possibilities
### 1. Google Business Profile APIs
- pros:
  - very accurate, and concise - two things LLMs need for good output
  - seemingly has most businesses
- cons:
  - very expensive ($0.025 / per call)

### 2. SerpAPI
- pros:
  - similar data
  - slightly less expensive
- cons:
  - but still also very expensive (~0.015 / per call)

### 3. Brave Search
- pros:
  - very cheap
- cons:
  - not as accurate or concise

I imagine I must be missing something here, surely there's a better API / data set that can map more niche places no?


Anyways, hope someone can get value out of this post. It's been an interesting project, finally getting to the point where it's becoming pretty useful for my personal needs.

2025-02-05 17:55:36,Building a Community Before or After MVP? Need Your Advice!,ManagerCompetitive77,1,"I’ve been working on something I’m really excited about, and I could use some advice from this awesome community. 🙌

Here’s the deal:

We’re building a **personalized AI-powered fintech app** to help kids (ages 8–18) learn real-life financial skills—things like saving, spending wisely, and even investing in stocks or crypto. Think of it as a modern financial coach for kids, but with gamified features like in-game currency, unlockable lessons, and parental controls to keep everything safe and supervised.

The problem we’re solving is simple: Platforms like Greenlight help kids manage money, but they don’t provide personalized insights or teach them how to make smarter financial decisions. Our goal is to fill that gap by combining AI recommendations with fun, engaging tools that kids actually want to use.

But here’s where I’m stuck:

**Should we focus on building a community NOW (before our MVP is ready), or wait until the product is live?**

On one hand, having a strong community from day one seems like it could make launching the MVP smoother. People would already be invested in the vision, and we’d have early adopters ready to test things out. Plus, communities often drive organic growth way better than traditional marketing.

On the other hand, I don’t want to waste time and energy building a community if we don’t have anything tangible to show yet. Maybe it’s smarter to focus all our resources on finishing the MVP first and then rallying people around it.

What do you guys think?

Here’s what I’m considering:

* **Option 1:** Start small and build a tight-knit community now. Share updates, gather feedback, and create buzz around the problem we’re solving.
* **Option 2:** Focus 100% on the MVP, launch it, and THEN start building the community around the live product.

I know there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but I’d love to hear your thoughts based on your own experiences. Have you ever tried building a community pre-MVP? Did it work, or was it a distraction?

Also, if you’re a parent or someone who’s passionate about financial literacy for kids, I’d love to hear what challenges you’ve faced when teaching kids about money. It might help us refine our approach!

2025-02-05 15:15:16,Using Blockchain for Internal Money Systems in Organizations - Thoughts and Feedback?,polishhammer-11,2,"Hey everyone,

I’m a computer science student, and I’m currently working on a project that is exploring the uses of blockchain to build an internal money system for organizations. The idea is to use blockchain to handle financial transactions within a company, everything from department-to-department transfers to payroll, while taking advantage of the transparency and security that blockchain offers.

Here’s what I’m thinking:

* With blockchain’s, every internal transaction would be recorded in a way that’s tamper-proof, offering total transparency for internal financial operations.
* Using blockchain’s smart contract capabilities, I’m hoping to automate processes to save time and reduce human error.
* Blockchain could help keep real-time track of funds across departments and provide an easier way to monitor cash flows and expenses across an organization.

Some potential uses:

* Instead of the usual bank transfers or internal ledgers, blockchain could streamline payments between departments, saving on transaction fees and delays.
* Especially for companies with global teams, blockchain could potentially handle payroll more efficiently and with fewer fees.
* Automating and tracking expenses in real-time could help prevent fraud and improve overall financial oversight.
* Blockchain could make managing the flow of funds between departments much smoother and more transparent.

I’m curious to hear if you think blockchain could be a good fit for internal systems like these. What do you see as the biggest challenges with using blockchain in this context? Scalability? Adoption? Would love to hear any examples of companies trying something similar or ideas on how to make it work in real-world scenarios.

It works like a **digital ""gullak"" (piggy bank)** integrated with UPI. Every time you make a payment, the app **rounds up the amount** (e.g., ₹342 to ₹350), and the extra change is stored in a locked wallet. This saved amount **cannot be withdrawn until your debt goal (e.g., ₹3000) is reached**, ensuring you gradually pay it off without thinking about it.

You can **set a threshold** (e.g., ₹500), meaning if your account balance is above ₹500, no rounding or saving will happen. This prevents unnecessary deductions when you have low funds.

2025-01-31 03:09:58,Zelle is Bricked,unga-unga,3,"EDIT: update: I was able to get to work (late) by flying a sign in the gas station parking lot stating ""Zelle stole my paycheck. Help me get to work."" Had a 5 and then a 10 within ~20 minutes and was on my way. Thanks to fellow poors for helping me serve another day to someone else's benefit!!

Right now I'm angry, and it's going to take me a while to calm down to the degree that I can more properly explain just how absolutely fucked this is.... They are playing around with people's lives, it's absolutely sick. 

I am broke. I have $1.10 and being able to get to work tomorrow depends on me receiving a pay-out from my contractee. Zelle has $1,250 of my money and says they ""don't see it on their end"" even though it is clearly visible on my end, senders have (all) been charged.

Just spent about 2 hours on the line with customer service & after having to b-tch at 23 people to receive any kind of real answer, I was told the best they can do is ""initiate a claim"" and that they will call me back ""within ten business days."" 

I should also state, it is unfathomable how non-existent support is. I had to call, call again, call again, call again, call again, rolling the dice until I hit someone who would actually do ANYTHING as opposed to reading a 2-line ""we're sorry"" copy-paste answer that had NOTHING to do with me or my concerns. By the end, I was ready for the aliens to just nuke & annihilate the planet, because obviously humans are grotesque & useless creatures.

This service is bricked. Beware, do not use zelle. They will arbitrarily hiccup and take your money. 

This service is supposed to be functional in cases of emergency, this is supposed to replace a cash/check transaction. They are not capable of rendering that service, and what's more - they will claim that they are not responsible?

I don't know WHAT larger institutions were thinking integrating this dumpster-fire into online banking. If I could look the people responsible in the eye right now, I would hold them down and obliterate their scrotum with my fists. This kind of delay can, and probably eventually will, cause someone's death. What if you were waiting on a payment to bribe your way out of a hostage situation with cartels in Colombia? What if you were in prison in Ghana, trying to make bail before being tossed into the cage with gen pop? 

This is not acceptable behavior when handling people's money. I have so many words for these bastards... 

In summary, FUCK you zelle, and FUCK all of the shit-bird ass-lickers running this ""banking"" business. It's a sad joke, taking people's lives and livelihoods and just shitting all over them like there were no consequences. FUCK you.

I really, really feel that the culture of silicon valley regards the torture of the poor as a casual & excusable consequence of ""making fat stacks."" There is no other explanation. Where is the SEC? Where is the class action? Sign me up. Class action NOW. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1ie5cfn/zelle_is_bricked/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1ie5cfn/zelle_is_bricked/

2025-01-29 14:50:07,Would This Gamified Financial Literacy App for Kids Fill a Market Gap?,ManagerCompetitive77,1,"Hey  👋 I’m brainstorming a product aimed at solving financial literacy for Gen Alpha (kids 8-18) by blending gamification, AI, and real-world tools. Existing platforms like Greenlight feel outdated—they lack adaptive learning and true engagement for digital-native kids. As fintech folks, I’d love your take: **Does this MVP concept have legs?** 





**Core Features**

1️⃣ **AI-Driven Financial Coaching** 

\- Algorithms analyze spending/saving habits to generate personalized:  

   \- Savings goals  

   \- Spending plans  

   \- Mock investment suggestions (stocks, crypto, ETFs) based on ROI + trends (think “Wealthfront for kids”).  

\- Uses behavioral economics principles to nudge better habits.  



2️⃣ **Gamification That Teaches**

\- Kids earn in-game currency by hitting savings goals or completing financial literacy modules.  

\- Currency unlocks features (e.g., “invest” in a simulated stock market, crypto, or NFTs).  

\- Parents/guardians set chores tied to rewards (auto-deposited post-completion).  



3️⃣ Parental Control Layer

\- Approve transactions over \[$X\] and block unknown senders (combatting finfluencers/SMS scams).  

\- Real-time notifications + transaction analytics (location, merchant, category).  



4️⃣ Tech Stack Integration

\- Physical + virtual debit cards (FDIC-insured partner).  

\- Supports Apple Pay, PayPal, Zelle (grandparent-friendly deposits).  

\- APIs for future expansion (open banking? crypto wallets?).  



5️⃣ Safety & Compliance

\- SOS alerts + location sharing (for emergencies).  

\- COPPA/GDPR-compliant by design.  

Why This Could Work

\- Kids learn by doing: Simulated investing, earning currency, and unlocking content mirrors gaming mechanics (high retention potential).  

\- Parents stay in control: Granular permissions without micromanaging.  

\- Scalable: Features like AI coaching could expand to teens/young adults later.  



**The Big Questions**

\- Market Fit: Is the parental control + gamification combo unique enough to disrupt Greenlight/Step?  

\- Tech Feasibility: How hard is it to balance COPPA compliance with features like simulated crypto?  

\- Monetization: Subscription model? Partnering with banks?  

\- Risks: Over-gamification diluting learning? Regulatory landmines?  





Example Use Case:  

A 12-year-old wants to buy Robux. Instead of instant gratification, the app:  

1. Recommends a savings plan.  

2. Unlocks a 3-minute lesson on “opportunity cost” after they save $20.  

3. Lets them “invest” part of their balance in a mock S&P 500.  

4. Parent approves the final purchase.  



Would this resonate with Gen Alpha? Or is it trying to do too much? 



Be Brutal:  

\- What features would you prioritize/drop?  

\- Are there technical hurdles I’m underestimating (e.g., real-time AI recommendations)?  

\- Would you let your kid use this?

# Merchant-Consumer standoff

* **Merchants save \~80% on fees** but why should consumers care
   * No rewards, no chargebacks, no credit float. Just… a receipt.
   * Unless prices drop why switch from your cashback card?
* **Emerging markets** like Brazil (Pix) and India (UPI) prove A2A works *where cards aren’t entrenched*. But in the US/EU swiping is effortless.

# The UX Problem

* **Tapping a card**: 1 second.
* **A2A at checkout**: Open app → Scan QR code → Authenticate → Confirm.
   * *Developers:* How hard is it to retrofit this into legacy POS systems? Will it require some new form of card from banks replacing normal Visa/Mastercard cards?
   * *Startups* are pushing ""Pay by Bank"" buttons, but will Starbucks or Walmart ever prioritize this over their rewards apps?

# The Regulatory Wildcard

* **Europe** has PSD2 and instant payment mandates. **India** forced discounts for UPI users.
* Will governments push A2A adoption, or let Visa/Mastercard keep their monopoly?

**TL;DR**: A2A solves a merchant problem, not a consumer one. **IMO**: until refunds, rewards, and UX match cards, swiping isn’t going anywhere. Any hot takes?

- Peer-To-Peer Lending with/without collateral using Soft and Hard credit checks.

- A more affordable Bank Account Management and Card Issuing API (this seems like the most unlikely idea)

- WealthTech???

I am a student and would want to hear more from people who are deeper into the space on some of the larger problems that could be tackled.

**Background:** My background is broadly defined by sales. I started my career working as a Management Trainee and then Inside Sales Representative for a commercial plumbing wholesaler for 7 years. Here I learned all about quotations, procurement, purchasing, warehousing, shipping, alongside all the typical skills you would expect from an inside sales role. 

Next I transitioned into the world of Fintech by taking a B2B account manager role where I conducted demos and full sales cycle to onboard clients to a digital spend management platform. After a year I was promoted, responsible for ramping strategic accounts and mitigating churn, but ultimately ended up doubling up with all my prior enrollment and user-onboarding responsibilities due to layoffs. Ended up managing more than 3,000 accounts so I had to create and implement scalable tactics to streamline enrollment, ramping, and churn mitigation. All the while our product was stagnant with little to no innovation coming from engineering plus our main lead source dried up. I feel that what was once a premier solution that I was very proud to be a part of, is being overtaken by its competitors. I am not in a position to be able to tackle the lead-gen problem or convince the company to allocate resources to update the product so think it's time to search for a new role.

**What I love:** I love personal finance and technology/ecommerce. I love interacting with people and being client-facing although I believe I could get that same satisfaction as long as I'm part of a collaborative team. I am very detail oriented and love diving into the nitty gritty to refine a product/process so that it's as close to perfect as we can get. In my next role I would like to build a technical expertise and be able to influence the product. 

**What I don't love:** I do NOT enjoy cold prospecting and lead-gen, although I have experience in this area and can do it in moderation. Most of my success in growing a book of business has been from engaging with hand-raisers/form fills and building out referrals/partnerships. 

My current OTE is $140k but realistically earning $110-125k.

**The ask!:** Some job roles I've explored and found interesting are those of a sales engineer, solutions consultant, and in customer success but I'd really like to get recommendations on what you think might be interesting or a good fit! Please feel free to submit any job listings, recommendations, or reach out to me directly if you'd be interest in chatting and swapping stories

2025-01-22 21:24:42,How to Start an Electronic Bank and Payment Gateway Targeting Underserved Markets?,al2za,2,"Hi everyone,

I’m exploring the idea of starting an electronic bank and payment gateway, specifically targeting markets with limited competition, such as certain African regions where payment gateways are scarce and banks charge high fees for prepaid Visa/Mastercard cards. My goal is to provide affordable, accessible financial services, including:

1. **Issuing prepaid Visa/Mastercard cards** with lower fees.
2. **Providing international IBANs** in USD, EUR, or other currencies as needed.
3. **Building a payment gateway** that supports local and international transactions.

**Here’s what I’m trying to figure out:**

1. **Should I separate the bank and payment gateway into two entities or combine them into one?**
   * Combining them might streamline operations, but separating them could offer more flexibility and compliance benefits.
2. **What are the key requirements to start such a project?**
   * Licensing, partnerships with card networks (Visa/Mastercard), compliance with PCI DSS, and integration with banking systems.
3. **What infrastructure is needed?**
   * A robust payment gateway platform, fraud detection systems, and APIs for seamless integration with banks and merchants49.
4. **How can I ensure affordability and accessibility?**
   * By reducing transaction fees, supporting multiple currencies, and offering user-friendly interfaces for both merchants and customers14.

**Why this market?**  
Many African regions lack reliable payment gateways, and banks often charge exorbitant fees for prepaid cards. By addressing these gaps, this project could empower businesses and individuals with affordable, secure financial tools14.

**Questions for the community:**

1. Has anyone here built a similar project? What challenges did you face?
2. Are there specific regulations or partnerships I should prioritize for African markets?
3. Any recommendations for payment gateway providers or APIs that support multi-currency transactions?
4. Should I focus on building the bank and gateway separately or as a unified system?

So, if you don't want to deal with the financial complexity of understanding complicated financial terms for things like using rent for buying a house, figuring out how much to save for retirement, what are the monthly payment for a loan or checking missed investment returns like how much I would get now if I invested in zoom during the pandemic, you can check out [www.profithindsight.com](http://www.profithindsight.com/)

Most of the financial calculator out there are very technical, and you might find it unnecessary to get exactly what the different variations are, then this tool is best design for you.

[Profit Hindsight](http://www.profithindsight.com/) is pretty basic and it takes complicated financial calculator and put them in a single sentence

For example:

House Calculator [www.profithindsight.com/housecalculator](http://www.profithindsight.com/housecalculator)

""If I currently pay 2000 in rent each month, saved 50000 for a down payment, and I can get a mortgage at 5% for 30 years, I might be able to buy a house for $348,050.59

Loan Calculator [www.profithindsight.com/loan](http://www.profithindsight.com/loan)

If I borrow 1000 for 2 years at 5 % interest, I will be paying $43.87 per month for a total of $1,052.91 with $52.91 Interest

Savings Calculator [www.profithindsight.com/savings](http://www.profithindsight.com/savings)

If I have 1000 and I save 100 per month for 2 years at 5 % interest I will have $3,623.53 after 2 years

Investment Calculator [www.profithindsight.com/investment](http://www.profithindsight.com/investment)

If only I have invested 10,000 in NVDA on January 22nd, 2024 I would have ...$23,608 today

We've spent the last few months working on an AI copilot for hedge funds — several are now using Zeno already (a mix between ChatGPT and the Bloomberg Terminal).

Now, we're making Zeno available to everyone. Why? Well, we think retail traders could really do with an AI platform to help them with their own portfolios.

**How to Use Zeno:**

* Ask any finance questions like you would to e.g., ChatGPT
* To reference a ticker, type $ followed by the company name (e.g., $Apple, $BTCUSD)
* Zeno will then generate a plan to tackle your question which you can then approve or modify before it proceeds with the analysis.
* Upload files for deeper analysis and interpretation.
* Save metadata or entire chats as white papers/presets (great for recurring workflows).
* Use the Tools page to modify workflows or assign functions.

**What Zeno Can Do:**

* Analyze stocks and companies (technical, fundamental, etc.).
* Aggregate news, summarize it, and gauge sentiment.
* Help build custom portfolios based on your criteria (e.g., mid-cap AI stocks).
* Perform data analysis (visual & numerical) and code generation for modeling.
* Answer general finance questions like any advanced LLM.

**All feedback (positive or negative) is greatly appreciated.**

2025-01-21 09:12:35,Is AI fixing the insurance industry’s biggest headaches ?,Growthfrrd,3,"Hi everyone! 👋 I’ve been working in the world of AI and Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) for a while now, and it’s fascinating to see how these technologies are reshaping the insurance industry. I’ve noticed a few conversations here about AI and insurance, so I thought I’d jump in to share some thoughts—and I’d love to hear your take on this too!

Insurance processes have always been a bit of a headache, right? Claims, underwriting, compliance—it’s a lot of work and often feels like it takes forever. That’s where IDP is making a difference. Here are a few ways it’s shaking things up:

* **Sorting Documents Like a Pro**: Imagine not having to manually sift through piles of claims or policy forms. IDP can auto-classify and organize documents in minutes, saving loads of time and cutting out the tedious work.
* **Spot-On Data Extraction**: Whether it’s claims forms, contracts, or policy documents, IDP pulls out the details with laser precision. No more endless double-checking for errors.
* **Validation Made Easy**: Forget the back-and-forth over inconsistent data. IDP automatically cross-checks information, reducing mistakes and ensuring everything’s accurate.
* **Smarter Claims Processing**: From organizing claim files to spotting potential fraud, IDP speeds up the entire process, helping insurers work smarter, not harder.

What I find most exciting is how IDP doesn’t just make backend processes smoother—it genuinely elevates the customer experience. Faster resolutions and fewer mistakes mean happier policyholders.

So, over to you:

* Have you seen IDP or similar tech in action in insurance?
* What’s the next big challenge you think AI could tackle in this space?

2025-01-18 11:53:29, How can we use FinTech to help kids learn about money?,ManagerCompetitive77,4,"Hey guys,

So, I’ve been thinking about how tech can actually make it easier for kids to learn about managing money. Honestly, schools don’t really teach this stuff, and it’s super important. Parents try, but it’s not always easy for them either.

**The Problem**

Kids don’t get enough real-life experience with money, especially in today’s digital world where everything is cashless. Parents want their kids to understand budgeting and saving, but they also need to make sure their kids don’t overspend or make bad money decisions.

Some apps are out there, but they have issues like:

* No proper parental controls (kids can move money around too freely).
* Lack of engaging features to actually keep kids interested.
* Expensive subscriptions that a lot of families find annoying.

**What I’m Thinking**

  
What if we had a FinTech app that actually solves these problems? Here’s my idea:

**1.Debit Card + Parental Controls:**

* Parents approve transactions and set limits, so kids can learn to spend safely.
* Real-time balance updates so there are no surprises.

**2. AI to Help:**

* AI tracks spending habits and suggests ways to budget better.
* It teaches kids about saving, taxes, and spending through simple advice.

**3.Make It Fun:**

Gamify the whole thing. Kids earn points for good money habits, unlock new levels, and even learn about stocks through a fun simulation game.

**What Do You Think?**

* Do you think this is something parents and kids would actually use?
* Is there anything specific you think we should include?
* If you’re a parent, how are you teaching your kids about money right now?

I’d really appreciate your thoughts. Let me know what you think about this idea!

2025-01-17 14:00:39,Looking for an open banking platform for startup,Puzzlehead_Edd,6,"Hey Reddit,

I’m building a startup that helps event organizers sell tickets online in Belgium and the Netherlands. We charge a small fee per ticket, so keeping transaction costs low is crucial for us to remain competitive.

We’ve had difficulties finding the right payment solution. Many traditional providers like Stripe, Adyen, and Mollie either declined to work with us or required high revenue thresholds (e.g., €500k annually), which just isn’t feasible for a new business.

We believe **open banking** could be a game-changer for us. It’s cost-effective, transparent, and allows direct bank-to-bank transfers, letting us avoid the high fees of traditional payment methods like credit cards. We also need a provider that can hold funds in escrow until the day after an event and then release payments to the organizers.

The problem? Most open banking platforms seem to require high transaction volumes or large revenues, making it hard for startups like ours to get started.

Does anyone know of an open banking provider that’s willing to work with startups or small businesses? Any recommendations or advice would be incredibly helpful!

2025-01-16 15:06:21,The Future of Customer-Centric Digital Banks: Bold Innovations for a Transformative Banking Experience,ravikant2509,1,"**Where We Are Today in Fintech Technologies**

The financial technology (Fintech) industry has transformed rapidly in recent years, evolving from basic online banking to offering seamless, AI-driven digital services. Today, Fintech encompasses:

* **Mobile Banking Apps**: Instant transactions, account management, and investment tools at your fingertips.
* **Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies**: Decentralized currencies and secure digital transactions that have reshaped cross-border payments.
* **AI-Powered Chatbots**: Automating customer support with increasingly natural and intelligent conversations.
* **Contactless Payments**: From mobile wallets to QR codes and wearables, enabling swift and secure transactions.

Despite these advancements, the Fintech landscape is far from its zenith. The future promises more innovative, **AI-driven technologies** designed to solve unmet customer needs, redefine trust, and deliver unprecedented personalization. Let’s explore some groundbreaking ideas that could shape the future of customer-centric digital banking.

 

**1. Emotional AI Banking: Understanding Customer Emotions in Real-Time**

Imagine a banking system that doesn’t just listen but understands you—your tone, your mood, and your concerns. Using **emotional AI**, future banks will interpret customers' emotions during interactions through technologies such as:

* **Voice recognition**: AI systems will analyze tone, pitch, and speech patterns to detect stress or frustration.
* **Facial recognition** (via video calls): Advanced algorithms will gauge facial expressions to assess emotional states.
* **Sentiment analysis**: Text-based chats will leverage AI to interpret the underlying emotions behind customer messages.

**Unparalleled Vision:** Emotional AI will go beyond reactive responses. For example, a customer considering a risky investment might display hesitation in tone or wording. The system, recognizing this uncertainty, could offer simplified, risk-free options or educational resources, enabling informed decisions. This empathetic approach builds trust and ensures customer satisfaction.

 

**2. Quantum Banking Assistants: Real-Time Financial Decision-Making**

Quantum computing will revolutionize how customers make complex financial decisions. These systems will process vast amounts of data in real-time, running simulations to offer instant, precise advice. Applications include:

* **Dynamic investment optimization**: Recommending portfolio adjustments in response to market fluctuations.
* **Loan risk simulation**: Predicting repayment scenarios based on customer history and economic trends.
* **Scenario planning**: Simulating life events, such as a career change or relocation, to predict financial outcomes.

**Detailed insight:** For example, a young entrepreneur seeking a business loan can rely on quantum-powered assistants to simulate thousands of potential market conditions, offering precise repayment strategies. This minimizes risks and empowers decision-making, crucial in volatile economies.

 

**3. Gamified Financial Ecosystems: Making Money Management Fun**

Financial education can be dull, but gamification will transform it into an engaging, rewarding experience. Future digital banks will deploy:

* **Daily challenges**: Encourage users to hit savings or spending targets for rewards.
* **Virtual reality (VR) simulations**: Let customers experience future financial scenarios, such as achieving a savings milestone or navigating economic downturns.
* **Reward systems**: Offer tangible benefits (e.g., cashback or interest rate reductions) for completing financial literacy quizzes or achieving budgeting goals.

**Detailed insight:** Picture a young couple managing their first joint account. Through an interactive VR platform, they simulate scenarios like buying a home or starting a family. These engaging tools teach budgeting skills while allowing them to visualize financial progress in real-time, creating a lasting impact.

 

**4. Biometric Payment Tattoos: The Next Step in Seamless Transactions**

Say goodbye to wallets and even mobile phones. The future of payments lies in **biometric payment tattoos**, leveraging **NFC technology** and biometric security. Features include:

* **Embedded NFC chips**: Enable contactless payments by tapping your wrist or finger.
* **Dynamic displays**: Tattoos could feature LED-like designs that show account balances or payment notifications.
* **Unique authentication**: Biometric data ensures transactions are secure and tied exclusively to the user.

**Detailed insight:** Imagine a frequent traveler paying for international transactions effortlessly with a tap of their wrist. The tattoo's embedded tech automatically converts currencies at real-time exchange rates, displaying the transaction details on their skin’s dynamic interface. This innovation combines convenience, security, and real-time feedback.

 

**5. Social Wealth Networks: A Community-Driven Financial Ecosystem**

Future banks will blur the lines between personal finance and community-driven growth through **social wealth platforms**:

* **Peer-to-peer savings groups**: Enable collective savings and shared interest benefits.
* **Crowdfunding for shared goals**: Let customers pool funds to co-invest in ventures or achieve community milestones.
* **Skill-based marketplaces**: Facilitate exchanges where customers trade services or surplus funds instead of currency.

**Detailed insight:** A social wealth network could unite local communities for co-investment in renewable energy projects. Through transparent blockchain technology, contributors track returns while achieving shared environmental goals. This approach fosters financial empowerment and collective responsibility.

 

**6. Predictive Life-Event Banking: Financial Solutions Before You Need Them**

Banks of the future won’t wait for customers to ask—they’ll anticipate needs using **AI-driven predictive analytics**:

* Automatically recommending college funds when a customer’s child is born.
* Pre-approving home loans as customers approach key life milestones like marriage or promotions.
* Alerting customers to potential gaps in retirement planning years before they arise.

**Detailed insight:** Consider a single professional receiving tailored investment advice as they approach mid-career milestones. The bank’s predictive AI aligns their savings with future priorities, offering a mix of property, equity, and retirement investment options before major life events occur.

 

**7. Digital Twin Financial Advisors: A Virtual You**

Imagine a **digital twin**—an AI-powered replica of yourself trained to mimic your financial behavior. These virtual advisors would:

* Simulate financial scenarios to predict long-term outcomes of decisions.
* Offer personalized advice aligned with your habits, values, and goals.
* Act as a coach, helping you stay on track toward your financial aspirations.

**Detailed insight:** A digital twin analyzes the financial impact of early retirement plans for a professional. It simulates how various decisions—like downsizing a home or transitioning to part-time work—would influence long-term savings, empowering the user to make confident, informed choices.

 

**8. Zero-Currency Banking: A New Value Economy**

Digital banks will lead the shift toward value-based economies, creating platforms where **currency isn’t king**:

* Rewarding customers with ""value units"" for volunteering, skill-sharing, or sustainable practices.
* Facilitating barter-like exchanges between users, backed by blockchain for transparency.
* AI converting these ""value units"" into monetary equivalents when needed.

**Detailed insight:** Picture a freelance graphic designer earning value units by offering services to a local community center. These units are later used to pay for childcare services, creating a balanced, sustainable exchange system that bypasses traditional currency.

 

**9. Eco-Intelligent Banking: Aligning Finance with Sustainability**

Banks will embed environmental awareness into every customer interaction:

* Real-time **carbon footprint calculators** linked to spending habits.
* Dynamic interest rates favoring eco-friendly purchases or investments.
* Rewards for adopting sustainable behaviors, such as energy-efficient home upgrades.

**Detailed insight:** A family planning to renovate their home receives a personalized loan package that incentivizes energy-efficient upgrades. As they make eco-friendly purchases, their loan interest rates drop automatically, reflecting their commitment to sustainability.

 

**10. Holographic Banking Interfaces: A New Dimension in Banking**

Screens will become obsolete as holographic technology enables:

* **Virtual consultations**: Meet with financial advisors as 3D holograms in your home or office.
* **3D portfolio visualizations**: See your financial assets in interactive, multi-dimensional charts.
* **Gesture-based controls**: Manage accounts and make payments with simple hand movements.

**Detailed insight:** Imagine an entrepreneur planning their annual budget using a holographic interface. With a few gestures, they adjust financial plans, visualize cash flow forecasts, and simulate the impact of hiring additional staff, all within a fully interactive, immersive experience.

 

**11. Voice-Activated Banking Ecosystems**

The future will see voice assistants seamlessly integrated into banking, enabling:

* **Natural language conversations** for financial management.
* **Voice commands** to pay bills, transfer funds, or inquire about account balances.
* Personalized insights delivered proactively by understanding speech patterns and preferences.

**Detailed insight:** Imagine asking your banking assistant, “Can I afford to take a vacation this month?” The system calculates your budget, upcoming expenses, and savings goals, then provides a clear, actionable response—all in real-time.

 

**12. AI-Powered Financial Wellness Coaches**

AI-powered wellness platforms will help customers achieve holistic financial health:

* Analyzing patterns in spending and offering behavioral coaching.
* Setting micro-goals for savings, investments, and debt management.
* Integrating with wearables to track emotional and financial stress.

**Detailed insight:** A financial wellness coach might notice overspending trends and suggest alternative habits or remind users of upcoming bill due dates to avoid penalties. Over time, these coaches learn and adapt, making smarter recommendations.

 

**13. Blockchain-Powered Smart Contracts**

Smart contracts will revolutionize transparency and automation in financial agreements:

* Auto-triggering conditions like loan approvals or payments.
* Simplifying real estate transactions by embedding terms in decentralized ledgers.
* Eliminating intermediaries for quicker, more secure agreements.

**Detailed insight:** For example, a customer applying for a business loan signs a blockchain-based smart contract. Upon meeting pre-set conditions (like cash flow targets), the loan is automatically disbursed, saving time and ensuring transparency.

 

**14. Personalized Loyalty Banking Programs**

Banks will leverage advanced data analytics to create personalized loyalty programs:

* Tailored rewards based on individual spending and saving habits.
* Partnerships with brands for exclusive offers, such as discounts on frequently purchased items.
* Dynamic adjustments to reward structures based on customer behavior.

**Detailed insight:** A frequent traveler might earn additional air miles for every financial transaction, while an environmentally conscious customer could receive rewards for eco-friendly purchases. Such programs increase customer engagement and retention.

 

**15. Augmented Reality (AR) Financial Tools**

Augmented reality will transform how customers interact with their finances:

* Visualizing spending trends and budget projections as AR overlays.
* AR-enabled tools to scan products in-store and assess their affordability in real-time.
* Interactive tutorials for financial literacy using AR environments.

**Detailed insight:** Picture wearing AR glasses in a store. As you scan an item, your projected monthly budget is displayed, helping you decide whether the purchase aligns with your financial goals.

 

**Conclusion**

The future of banking lies in **personalized, tech-driven, and customer-first innovations**. By integrating **AI, quantum computing, biometrics, and sustainable practices**, digital banks can redefine how customers interact with their finances. These ideas aren’t just about convenience—they’re about creating meaningful, transformative experiences that empower customers and build lasting trust.

I’m exploring a new way to send small amounts of money (like $5 or $10) across borders—practically as easy as sending a text. Think of it like buying a coffee for a friend who’s living abroad.

# What’s the Problem We Want to Solve?

* **High Fees:** Many traditional methods charge you $10–$40 just to send $30. That’s pretty painful if you only need to send a little.
* **Slow Processing:** Sometimes it takes days for a transaction to clear. And weekends? Forget it.
* **Frustrating Details:** Bank info, SWIFT codes—too many hoops to jump through for smaller sums.

# What We’re Proposing

* **1.** Ultra-low fees for sending tiny amounts (like $5–$50).
* **2.** Quick transfers—within minutes, regardless of weekends or banking hours.
* **3.** Extremely simple UX: possibly just a link or phone number.

*(We’re keeping the technical details under wraps for now—just imagine a faster, more affordable channel to send or receive funds.)*

# Questions for You

1. **Have you ever wanted to send or receive small amounts (under $50) across borders?**
2. **What’s your biggest pain point with current solutions (PayPal, Western Union, bank wires, etc.)?**
3. **If there was a way to send a few bucks without all the bank hassle, would you use it?**
4. Any red flags if it involves new tech (like digital wallets)? Or is cost and speed all that matters?

It was time-consuming and honestly pretty draining.

So, I’m building a tool in Python that automatically summarizes these reports and lets you dig deeper into specific sections—kind of like having a conversation with the document. I’m also adding a feature that auto-generates charts and visuals from the data to make analysis quicker and easier.

After that internship, I got really interested in machine learning and have been studying it since. This project is part of that learning process, but I want it to actually be useful for people in finance.

If you’re a financial analyst, in wealth management, or just someone who works with earnings reports, I’d love your thoughts:

* What features would make this tool a game-changer for you?
* Which parts of earnings reports do you focus on the most?
* Would auto-generated charts help, and if so, what kind of visuals would you find useful?

Any feedback would be super helpful. Feel free to be as detailed as you want—I’m all in on making this as useful as possible.

* Currently, you either pay $15K+ or guess if your KYC implementation is correct
* No way to test against real-world scenarios before going live
* Documentation and best practices are scattered or behind paywalls

**The idea:**  
A developer-first platform that lets you:

* Test your KYC implementation against pre-built scenarios
* Validate against current regulatory requirements
* Get specific feedback on implementation issues
* All before spending money on production API calls

**Questions:**

1. Is this something you'd use?
2. What would be the most valuable features?
3. What scenarios would you want to test?

I’m doing  discovery work and would love to hear about the processes your team goes through to ensure your content, marketing, and sales materials meet securities compliance standards.

* Sales or marketing teams draft the materials.
* These are sent to a compliance team member for review.
* Feedback loops ensue, sometimes going back and forth multiple times.
* The whole process typically takes 1–3 days from draft to approval/publishing.

Does this sound familiar? Or does your team approach it differently?

* What works well in your process?
* What are the biggest challenges or pain points? and how often do they occur?

2025-01-12 16:50:37,What are the average metrics of an order book?,plonkster,2,"Hi all,

  
I'm writing an order matching engine, and I'm at a point where I'm working on performance optimisation.

  
For that I generated a dataset of 10 million order creation requests, of which 1 million result in a trade and I used pretty much arbitrary order size and type distributions.

  
As it can have an impact on performance, I'd like to know if there is any publicly available information on REAL-WORLD metrics such as:

\- Average order size

\- Distribution of order sizes

\- Distribution of order types (market, limit, FOK, IOC, SL, OCO and so on)

\- Average order TTL - i.e. how long on average would a, say, limit order stay in the book before it's either filled or canceled

\- Stats on order modification (cancelations, price changes, amount changes)

  
...And any such metrics.

  
Analyzing available live order books on Binance and such didn't help very much. When a trade is broadcast, I have no idea of most of the metrics relevant to it. The taker order could be a market order hitting the book or could be an IOC limit one, the maker order could be an iceberg / shmiceberg / etc, or an OCO order, well basically there's little info other than that a trade has been created and maybe L2 values changed a bit.

  
Thanks for any insights.

3. For such a small amount, would there be country specific regulations that the business must follow - eg. will it need to provide any tax documents etc to the recipient/winner of the giveaway?

Thanks for any insights!

2025-01-08 18:14:05,From Banking to Fintech,___FlowerGirl___,2,"I honestly need to make more money and hit the cap in my current career. I have a bachelors degree in PoliSci (I know) and started working at a bank right out of college because I needed a job. I’ve been in banking for almost 10 years (5 working in a branch) and 5 years in operational banking (testing and monitoring). 

I am aware that I have limited skills but I cannot spend another 10 years in operational jobs and low pay. Honestly, any job I’ve had, I’ve learned on the go and have always impressed people. So this makes me think maybe I can do this too… but I have no idea where to start. 

Are there any fintech jobs where I can get foot in the door with the experience I have and then build on it? I make around 70k now, so compensation needs to be around this or more. At the moment I’m not really open to taking courses/classes but if necessary I will. 

Can someone hold my hand and help me please🫠

I'm the founder of a real-time payment app designed for Canadians, leveraging Payments Canada's real-time rails and open banking. We've built a prototype that showcases the major use cases we aim to solve and have had some discussions with folks in the fintech space.

To take this to the next level, we need two things:

1. **Partnership with a Credit Union**: We're looking for a credit union that can use our product and integrate it into their ecosystem. However, I'm finding it challenging to connect with decision-makers within credit unions who can help us include our product in their systems.
2. **Research Collaboration**: We're also seeking a research group that can assist us in building the product. In return, they would get the latest research project opportunities.

Any thoughts, advice, or connections would be greatly appreciated!

I’m 23 years old and a graduate from a mid-tier business school in France. Right now, I’m living in New Zealand to improve my English and explore new cultures.

I’m planning to launch my career in FinTech as a Sales when I return to France in about 10 months. I already have 2 years of experience in Sales (as part of an apprenticeship). My previous role was in the maintenance industry for elevators and escalators, where I handled contracts, repairs, and modernization projects.

I also had the chance to temporarily take on a management role during a colleague’s maternity leave, supervising a team of 7 technicians. The projects I sold typically ranged from $2,000 to $30,000. That said, I worked with an already-established client portfolio, so I have limited experience in prospecting (cold emailing/calling).

I’m passionate about technical sales and technology, and I’d like to know which specific Sales roles I should target to eventually grow into a management position.

Additionally, I want to make better use of my evenings by replacing Netflix with training or resources that could give me an edge during my job search. I’ve tried some courses on EdX, but they felt a bit dull. Do you have any recommendations for YouTube channels, podcasts, or books that could help?

Lastly, I know it might be early to ask, but how can I accurately evaluate the salary I should aim for given my current experience?

Looking forward to your advice!

2024-12-27 17:12:23,Asking for an advice about a decision making assistant.,Professional_Rice_58,0,"About a year ago I and my business partner founded RangeTeller - a fintech startup that enables banks to formulate and assess lending strategies.

The problem we solve is that every year banks reject millions of personal loan applications because the credit score of an applicant is not high enough. As a result, in the last decade banks have lost $50 billion of the personal loans market to fintech lenders.

Our solution is a framework which supports banks in formulating and assessing transparent lending strategies tailored to their specific goals: either identify creditworthy clients overlooked by the credit score system, or reduce risk by avoiding bad customers, or increase diversity of customers.

Using RangeTeller lenders can easily integrate their knowledge into a built-in ML framework. Unlike the credit score approach, RangeTeller is a multidimensional model, and the results are fully transparent and meet the highest compliance standards. Basically, RangeTeller is an extra Data Science team that works 24/7.

We have a fully functioning MVP. We did a successful case study with a data analytics startup specializing in alternative credit scoring. We have been accepted in the UK to the NatWest and to the Barclays Eagle Lab accelerator programs.

Judging by numerous indicators and testimonials we are on the right track in fintech. But in general our product is a decision making assistant, and therefore it can be used in different areas, for example in insurance. We are fintech professionals, but unfortunately we know next to nothing about insurance models. Moreover, there should be some areas where our product could be used, but we just don't know what they are.

We would like to know what those areas are, and how we could progress there.

2024-12-27 01:52:48,Virtual Debit cards.,Enigmax007,1,"Hi Guys, I am an entrepreneur and need guidance regarding digital payments. Before I can dive into what I am trying to develop I need to understand a few things. In the United States should you try to open a bank account, one of the key factors a bank usually needs is an address to open a bank account. Once an account is opened, you are given a debit card and should you want a credit card then you can apply for one. But I know that nowadays banks, do offer virtual card numbers for both debit and credit so that you can make payments online and of course use it with your Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.

These cards use Visa and Mastercard as payment processors to process payments. But here is my confusion as I have seen websites that offer virtual debit card numbers without entering any address but just an OTP and Mastercard or Visa sending them a virtual card number and no bank is involved. My question is how is that possible I am living in an x country but I am getting a virtual card through an app/website just using my phone number when I don't even reside in the respective country where the app is from.

Are Mastercard and Visa allowed to push out card numbers without an address?

If they are then what form of address are they using. Is it like one address is being used to offer multiple virtual cards to users on the site/app?

I am a noob and I am trying to understand the structure of how things work in digital payments realm. Hence any help is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1hn40p3/virtual_debit_cards/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/1hn40p3/virtual_debit_cards/

During these years, I’ve gravitated toward Web3 hackathons, which I really enjoy, but I’m not as passionate about my studies.

I’d like to go to England for my master’s (I’m a continental European), and I’ve been considering different options: Finance, Computer Science, and FinTech. I’m wondering whether a FinTech master’s would help me land the hybrid role I’m aiming for, one that bridges the IT and finance worlds (for example, at a Web3 company), or if I should focus more on CS (or Engineering), or perhaps if Finance would be a better choice.

It’s a tough decision, but I need to make it quickly, as applications for international students are closing soon.

2024-12-13 07:12:54,Career in Fintech,Competitive_Most_623,3,"Hi everyone,

Long-time lurker here! Over the past few years, I’ve been immersed in startup environments, primarily in Operations and CX-focused roles. I’ve been fortunate to be paid fairly well, and for the past year, I’ve worked in the crypto-banking space in a BizOps/Founder’s Office capacity, spanning CX, risk, and operations. However, my current company is shutting down, and I’m transitioning into a Lead Ops role at another fintech firm, where I’ll be developing their CX framework for a UPI offering.

While these experiences have been rewarding, I’m now seriously considering pursuing an MBA in Singapore. My main motivation is to bridge gaps in my understanding of core finance and strategy, which I feel are critical for my career growth. I view the MBA as a stepping stone to acquire those skills and pivot into more strategic and product-focused roles.

I understand that opinions on the value of an MBA can vary widely, but I’m seeking advice on how my current experience could shape my career prospects during and post-MBA. I’ve always worked in dynamic, early-stage (Series A/D) environments, which required me to wear multiple hats beyond my primary KRA. This has helped me develop a problem-solving mindset and technical proficiency, often on par with or exceeding the PMs I’ve worked alongside.

Would my background in CX design, BizOps, and risk in startup settings make me a strong candidate for strategy and product roles at companies like Visa or Mastercard? Do companies like these value the kind of diverse experience that comes from working in startups, or would I need to specialize further to make the leap?

I’d appreciate insights from anyone who has walked a similar path or has experience navigating the MBA landscape for a career pivot.
