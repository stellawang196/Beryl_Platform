I have about 250K in FZDXX which is being saved for a house down payment, I was hoping it would be this year but as I work remote and can’t transfer my job I might have to wait a few years closer to retirement.

Is it safe to keep it in FZDXX in the current financial market or should I position this somewhere else in Fidelity?

2025-04-10 19:08:38,Anyone else adjust their investing strategies?,dezahpp,1,"Ever since Trump took office, I've lost a bunch of confidence in the US market. I've shifted over my 403b retirement investment strategies to be 100% international funds. I just feel that I won't need to be constantly worried and shook about every single Trump news headline that comes up daily. I mean I still do since whatever happens in the US still affects the global market but at least I have a little more of peace of mind and then I'll see how everything plays out after a few months to see if I will need to adjust my strategies again. I was kind of doubting my change and shift in investing the other day but felt validated today as I am back in the green and everyone else that I know are still in the red with their retirement accounts. It just feels like international markets are a much more stable place for investments as US market is too volatile and unpredictable right now. It feels like it's turned into a meme crypto market like Solana lol.

I don't have the mental fortitude to deal with all of these daily Trump changes and headlines so I'll just stay away for a bit even though everyone keeps saying just buy the dip. Plus I'm out here just trying to survive buying groceries and paying rent for my family while everything is constantly getting more expensive so I don't have the disposal income like some of you guys are reporting in here lol.

And of course, I must send him 3% of loss pool before he sends me the money.

In the post linked, OP said he dodged a bullet.

Anyway, I'm making this post in the hopes it ranks on Google, since when I've searched for ""Final-Lock789 scam reddit"" nothing showed up.

tl;dr: We are likely within a few short months from market bottom if not already there. 

The top graph shows RUT (Russell Small Cap 2000), which has been a reliable indicator of where we have been in terms of days to market bottom for the last 35 years. 

For the top graph (RUT), the y-axis is the log(price) which is required to get the trend line functions to work properly - not useful other than getting the script to work. Each trend line is a standard deviation from the log-linear mean (center black line). The vertical red lines are the transition from one standard deviation below the mean to the next market bottom. The SPY is the graph below which shows how it correlates to RUT pricing and market bottoms. I added the days to market bottom as a bar chart and, as shown, only the two major recessions hit >100 days. With the current price of RUT we are 14 days into the count.  

The main point is that when this index is below one standard deviation from the mean (bottom gray line) it's a good buying opportunity - and - shows that we are likely not far from a market bottom regardless of the situation. What I consider to be the ""short-term pain"" rhetoric.

Considering the extreme overvaluations during the 2000 market top and the havoc that occurred during the financial debacle during the end of the 2000s, the max time from the bottom was around 180 days (6 months) based on this analysis. 

That being said, the market is forward looking so if we hit 2 standard deviations below the mean, which has been close to occurring in all four recessions, then expect the economy to feel pain with unemployment rising for a an additional year (economic recovery lags market bottoms).

2025-04-10 13:45:37,Archer Aviation (ACHR) is Looking Like a Solid Bet 🌟✈️,Own_Specialist_6538,0,"So, Archer Aviation has been making some waves lately, and there are plenty of positive signs.
First off, let’s talk about today’s action—ACHR saw a nice 3% bump in its stock price, which is always a good sign. It traded as high as $7.28 before closing at $6.86. Not bad at all for a company that’s still in growth mode. The volume was a bit lighter than usual (about 9.7 million shares vs. an average of 19.9 million), but that doesn’t necessarily mean anything negative—sometimes it just means investors are holding tight and waiting for the next big move.

Now, here’s where things get even more interesting. Analyst upgrades are pouring in for Archer, with Cantor Fitzgerald raising their price target to $13.00, up from $10.00, and issuing an """"overweight"""" rating. That’s not the only upgrade; other firms like Canaccord Genuity and Needham have followed suit, bumping their price targets to around $13.00 and $13.50. Even Deutsche Bank joined the party, lifting their target to $15.00. Overall, analysts seem pretty bullish with a """"Moderate Buy"""" consensus rating and a price target of $11.61. That’s a solid upside potential from where it’s trading right now.

On the financial side, Archer is looking healthy, with a low debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.16, meaning they aren’t over-leveraged. The company also reported better-than-expected earnings last quarter, posting an EPS of -$0.30 when analysts were expecting -$0.40. Small wins like that go a long way in building investor confidence.

There’s also been some institutional interest. Big institutions jumping in is often a sign that the stock has long-term potential. Plus, insiders are still holding onto a good chunk of shares, with 9.75% ownership—so they have skin in the game, too.

Of course, like any stock, ACHR isn't without risk, but with strong analyst support, solid financials, and increasing institutional backing, it seems to be moving in the right direction. Keep an eye on this one—it could be a solid play as the electric aviation space takes off.

Is this extremely risky? People have told me that I shouldn't do this because Chinese stocks have a history of fraud, and don't have tight financial controls. I did my research and think that this is a good company, and right now my number 1 concern is the government crackdown on businsses like they did several years earlier to the education Sector. The earnings of this company is good and it is quite profitable, so I think it should do good over time.

I then decided to change to DCA the remaining 25k€ putting 5k€ every Monday. I could buy at the lowest price this Monday, and I was hoping to buy even lower the next ones, but now Trump fuked up my plans again...

In summary:

- I bought 25k€ lump sum before a -15% crash  
- I started DCAing 5k€ a month and could only deploy 5/25k€ before markets went back up +10%...

Now I'm sad and questioning if I should continue DCAing. I wasn't checking the markets yesterday otherwise I could think to deploy it all since MSCI World retouched the same price I bought on Monday.

Now for 90 days there will be nothing happening anymore, which sucks... Maybe I should put the remaining money back into deposit account and wait hoping for another crash in 3 months.

That breakdown as follows:

5% BND/BNDX

49% VTI

34% VXUS

7% VEU

5% VIGAX

I still want to follow the boglehead strategy for the most part, I still have a certain amount of risk tolerance (40 yo and would like to retire by 60 due to medical conditions and have been using money from dividends and mandatory RMD's to supplement my income) and don't need to go harder with bonds. But recent events have made me rethink my strategy, slightly.

Essentially, I don't feel super confident in tech or the entire US market in general due to P/E ratios and the chaotic nature of everything right now. I am interested in diversifying a percentage from VTI and invest into a US ETF that is more focused on blue chip stocks.

As far as my international exposure, I am interested in diversifying a percentage of that into an ETF that is invested in international holdings that might be shielded from some of the volatility of US markets.

Technically this will not be a 3 fund portfolio, something more like a 5 fund portfolio, but essentially following the advice of John Bogle's strategy and using Vanguard (I also have 2-3 years of cash on the side between HYSA, Money Market.. about 10% of what's invested in the market) For someone in my position, what could I look into? I would love to VTI and chill but it doesn't feel so chill and has forced me to rethink my risk tolerance, somewhat. I'm just interested in some general advice regarding what those options might be, but I'm also interested if anyone else is going through a similar decision making process as well as anyone with different or opposing opinions that I should take into account.

Phase 2. Trump comes out with huge tariffs that look to destroy the economy and cause recession. The logical step is to sell before it's too late, market is crashing and stock prices go down as people sell. Some people buy but warnings everywhere ' Do not be a hero. Do not try to stop a falling knive ' Great Depression 3.0 incoming, we're all screwed.

Phase/ Incident 3. Someone comes out who claims to have inside information that Trump is planning to pause the tariffs for 90 days. And there are talks with most countries so chances are they won't even happen anymore. Things are looking up again, people start getting hope, markets look to recover. 
Trump comes out ' the rumous are not true. There will be no pause. Tariffs are mEDiciNE ' People freak out and sell, Trump's friends are buying harder than ever. Stock price swings back and forth as a result.

Phase 4. Few more days pass, Trump comes out and proudly declares, actually, I AM pausing the tariffs for 90 days. Suprise, motherfuckerz ! Suddenly, we're not heading to a recession anymore, market is booming, stock prices go up instantly. 



All smokes and mirrors, but Trump's insiders are much richer in a few days, while the rest is poorer.

Aside from that I have my Roth TSP with work, a pretty immature whole life insurance policy/account (still not sure about this), and savings in an HYSA that I'm using to save for a house. 

My son's dad and I are separated, and he started a 529 account for our kiddo in early 2023. He's contributed 12k and it's at about 25k. Our son is almost 14. I would trust my money with him if I were to add to the existing one, though truly my preference is to keep our finances separate. But I want to do what is best.

My question is, is it worth it for me to start a 529 for him right now as well - is that the best way to start saving for him on my end at this time? And how much would I need to contribute right away for it to have a chance of being somewhat successful by the time he would go to college given I'm starting so late (I know time is the true key, but here we are)?

I believe it's correct that if he finds an alternative way to pay for college or does not go to college in some form, if we let the money sit in the 529s for 15 years, our son could then roll it into his Roth IRA which would be pretty cool for him I think...

2025-04-10 05:49:06,Time to buy gold and silver?,Moirailogist,3,"The tariff war is going into the 2nd phase: U.S. vs. China. Before U.S. market opens tomorrow, I expect China will increase tariff on U.S. goods to 125%. There are some reports that China is evaluating a stimulus package, but that is uncertain yet.

  
In the next 90 days, we will see U.S. negotiates with all other countries and regions, tries to block China from a new world trade organization, and tries to implement a worldwide tariff on China goods. During this process, U.S. may take other measures including banning transhipment, delisting China stocks or ADRs, cutting off more technologies, pausing interest payments, or confiscating China assets. Those could be threats or could be implemented. China is likely to impose tariff on U.S. service revenues. There is a small chance that the trade war will escalate into a real war: China side believes its navy is getting close to the U.S. level and can protect its oil import, while U.S. side believes its navy is far superior. Well, most Americans don't know U.S. no longer has strong shipbuilding or repairing capability, which is why Trump is so eager to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.

  
Then the $700B question is: what will China do with its U.S. treasury holding? It is becoming a risky asset, even if we don't talk about basis trade. China already sold $50B two days ago, and it needs a place to spend its USD. With weakness in worldwide currencies, one plausible approach is buy physical gold and silvers.

I don't want to sell all of the shares, just a portion.  And, I'd only like to do so at a price higher than current market.  So, I'd like to tell the brokerage to place a GTC limit sell order for X shares at $Y.  I understand what this is and how to do it.  However, I would also like there to be something of a stop-loss order on *those particular shares* should they go up past a certain price but not quite make it to the limit price.   Can this be done without babysitting the limit sell order and placing a GTC stop-loss after it goes past the lower amount?  I prefer to set it and forget it...if it never goes above the stop-loss limit (and therefore the limit sell, either), I am fine to hang onto those shares.  If this can be done and is a known strategy, what is the name for it?

Example

Own 1000 shares of $200 stock.  Wanting to sell off 200 shares at a minimum of $210 but would like to try for $220 and will settle for $210 on the way back down if it doesn't make it there.

The sharp rise in volume, 10 minutes before the official announcement - pure coincidence, maybe.

This is just something to remember whenever you invest in the stock market now. Insider trading directly takes money out of the market from less informed investors, and that's all of us. The presidency has now established that they can siphon part of your money through its information asymmetry. This is effectively a tax on all investment in the stock market. 

So what can we do about this?

Unfortunately, seemingly very little. The powers that be are in charge of pressing charges, so no charges will be levied. As they say, we just ""don't have the cards"". If anyone has any suggestions, please let us know. Until then, all we can do is remember that now, any investment carries an implicit tax, and trade / invest accordingly.

**""....TIME TO BUY DJT""**

2025-04-09 19:17:30,"🎭 ""Tariff Theater"": Why the 7% Rally Is a Mirage, Not a Market Rebound",KriosDaNarwal,347,"The recent 7% rally in equities, coinciding with the Trump administration’s decision to roll back certain tariffs to 10%, has been interpreted by some as the beginning of a broader policy shift. In reality, the fundamental landscape remains unchanged. If anything, the superficial nature of the rollback only highlights the extent to which markets have latched onto optics in the absence of substantive improvement. This rally in equities has not been mirrored by the bond market.

The core dynamics of U.S. trade remain adversarial. China, the United States' largest goods supplier, continues to face high and sustained tariff exposure. The aggregate effective rate, factoring in prior rounds of reciprocal escalation, remains above 100% in several key categories. The European Union has not softened its stance, and in many areas, has reinforced its commitment to retaliatory measures. These are not temporary frictions; they are structural conflicts driven by divergent regulatory philosophies and increasingly protectionist trade regimes.

The administration’s trade team has pointed to limited agreements with smaller economies as signs of progress. But these are largely symbolic, wins on paper that have little bearing on global supply chains or multinational corporate strategy. For firms with cross-border exposure, especially in manufacturing, technology, and retail, the operating environment remains materially constrained. Cost structures have not normalized, logistics remain fragile, and geopolitical uncertainty continues to inhibit capital deployment.

Multinational firms, Apple being a key example, have not seen operational relief. Their upstream suppliers are still entangled in the broader tariff gridlock, and downstream demand remains vulnerable to price transmission effects. Margins are thinning, and strategic flexibility is diminishing as firms are forced to hedge against policy volatility rather than invest into expansion.

Beneath the surface, core macroeconomic indicators point to a deteriorating environment. Unemployment, while still moderate by historical standards, is trending upward. Real wage growth has stalled. Inflation, particularly in services and shelter, remains persistently elevated, even as headline CPI shows deceleration. Consumer credit delinquencies are rising. These are not the foundations of a sustainable recovery.

The current rally in equities is not being underwritten by earnings strength. On the contrary, forward guidance across several sectors has been revised downward, and earnings compression is visible in both nominal and real terms. What we are seeing in markets is not confidence, it is positioning. With liquidity abundant and volatility elevated, capital is rotating into risk on technicals, not fundamentals.

To complicate matters further, market behavior is beginning to resemble that of the late 1980s. Volatility is no longer episodic, it is persistent. The Federal Reserve’s posture remains hawkish, and the long end of the yield curve continues to rise, undermining equity valuations and tightening financial conditions in the real economy. At the same time, geopolitical dislocation is contributing to a growing perception that U.S. assets, once the global default for safe and productive capital, are no longer as insulated as they once were.

Foreign capital inflows are beginning to waver, and the strength of the dollar, long a source of stability, is now a headwind for export competitiveness. In this context, the idea that a marginal tariff adjustment constitutes a policy breakthrough is difficult to justify. If anything, it highlights how thin the narrative support for this rally truly is.

Until there is a credible de-escalation of trade tensions with China and the EU, a normalization of inflation and labor market conditions, and a return to earnings-led equity performance, the market remains structurally fragile. The recent rally is not a signal of recovery. It is a speculative drift, driven by hope, not data.

Originally planned to hold longer, but with the announcement, I’m now looking to exit or hedge. I want to make sure I don’t accidentally trigger a pattern day trading (PDT) violation and get locked out of my account.

Here’s how I’m currently positioned:

Roth IRA: Bought stocks in some of the Magnificent Seven, along with UPRO (leveraged S&P 500 ETF) and a few crypto-related ETFs.

Personal margin brokerage account: Bought SPY call options, a call option on UPRO, and some UPRO stock (which I already sold — one day trade already counted here).

Crypto account (linked to the brokerage): Bought some Ethereum.

Given all that, I’m trying to figure out:

What can I sell or close out without triggering PDT restrictions?

Do the rules apply differently to my Roth IRA, my margin account, and the linked crypto account?

If I’ve already made one day trade in my margin account today, what are my limits now?

I want to be strategic about how I unwind or hedge, so any clarity on how PDT rules work across these accounts would be a big help.

Given the unpredicibality of the market over the next few years, my financial advisor is advising that I allocate more of my funds to more market-resitant investment vehicles like real estate funds, apartment funds, and QOZs. 

His theory is that the market will continue to get worse. And that even if it bounces back, S&P growth will hardly keep up with inflation over the next decade. Prior to this crash, he was advising a smaller allocation to those funds given the higher expected return from S&P, Vanguard, etc, but now believes the ROI will be similar to these funds in a best case scenario, and higher in a worst case scenario. 

The logic makes sense, however I am skepitcal, given that the apartment funds, etc. will be under his management. 

  
Of course none of us can really predict what will happen, but I am curious if anyone else is asking themselves the same things and has an opinion they'd be open to sharing?

Like many of you, I’ve been thinking a lot about how to handle my finances during this economic downturn. I’m reaching out to get your thoughts on where to park my money for the foreseeable future—hopefully just the short term.

Up until now, I’ve been consistently dollar-cost averaging into the S&P 500 each month, which has been going well. Normally, I’d continue with that strategy since I’m still far from retirement.

About two years ago, my wife and I were fortunate enough to purchase a multi-family home in Queens, NY with an interest rate in the mid-4% range. Given the recent market volatility—and what seems like more uncertainty ahead—I’m considering two possible changes to our current plan:

**Option A:** Lower our monthly investment into the market and redirect that money toward extra mortgage payments.  
**Option B:** Lower our monthly investment and move that money into our high-yield savings account (HYSA), then make a larger lump-sum payment toward the mortgage at the end of the year.

That said, a part of me still thinks I should just stay the course and continue investing into the S&P 500 as usual.

I’d love to hear what you all think. What would you do in this situation?

I also think Trump, China, Canada and Mexico, and the EU all know that is the path we're all on and I dont think ANY of them truly want that. 

We're now 2 months into all of this, if I'm right deals will probably start coming end of this month or sometime next month and the market will rip back just on some sort of hope for once.

I have about 1-2k that I could invest which yeah people might laugh at that cause maybe its not a lot but its just what I have and what I can do, and I would be ok with investing it knowing that the stocks potentially go even lower, knowing eventually it will hopefully recover but I figure might as well do it now instead of waiting trying to time the market and losing out on the ""sale"". I figure I could buy a bit of Apple, NVidia, Meta, Google stuff like that that's generally pretty safe but is on sale, am I right about that, or the S&P500.

So a couple questions I have:

1. What platform or app should I use to buy stocks, is robinhood good? Some of my friends use it, if not what to use

2. Lets say I have 2k to invest should I do it separately over 2 weeks, or over 2 months, or $500 a week, or all at once?

3. Is there any measure I need to take when buying a stock, do I just buy it and its there in the platform until the day I take it out?

4. Best things to invest in, or from your experiance best thing to invest in? As I mentioned above those are kind of the stocks I figure id try and get a couple of

5. Any other general advice you can give id appreciate, again not trying to do to much or go all in on stocks but I figured again I have some extra money id rather invest while the market is down then just have it be sitting doing nothing

Hong KongCNN — 

China unveiled retaliatory tariffs of 84% on imports of US goods on Wednesday, further inflaming a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.

The announcement means China has increased its intended levy on US imports by another 50 percentage points from the initial amount that was set to take effect on Thursday, matching the additional charge that US President Donald Trump has already imposed on Chinese goods.

Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs took effect earlier on Wednesday. China was the hardest-hit nation with a levy of at least 104% on all its goods.

2025-04-09 06:48:50,"Forget ceteris paribus, the world is not ending.",Cormyster12,0,"When the market dips, the headlines scream ""Recession."" But are we actually in one? Or is this just another case of conflating stock prices with the real economy?

Lately, a wave of panic has hit financial media over the reintroduction of tariffs by the U.S. administration. Critics are framing this as a reckless economic move destined to collapse global trade. But here’s the thing: these tariffs were not a surprise. They were telegraphed throughout the campaign, reaffirmed after the election, and framed as part of a broader strategy to bring supply chains home.

So why the market panic?
Because investors love rhetoric, but fear action. Tough talk is tolerable—it creates volatility without consequences. But when that talk turns into policy, it forces a repricing of risk. Tariffs raise input costs, threaten corporate margins, and rattle assumptions built on decades of globalization. But that doesn’t automatically mean we’re heading into a recession.

In fact, this time might be different.

While tariffs are inefficient in the short term (yes, prices rise, demand dips, and you get some economic drag), they are also a lever—one used to reset the table. In response to this policy shift, the U.S. is experiencing a surge of domestic investment. Billions are flowing into new infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and energy production. Supply chains are being rebuilt. Semiconductors, electric vehicles, even steel—these industries are seeing real capital commitments.

That’s not recessionary. That’s reindustrialization.

GDP is about production, not vibes. And with that much money moving into physical investment, it’s difficult to imagine back-to-back quarters of contraction. Markets may be jittery, but the real economy is gaining muscle.

There’s also a philosophical point here. For decades, Western economies have relied almost exclusively on demand-side policy. Stimulus checks. Interest rate tweaks. QE. Meanwhile, the productive base hollowed out. Resilience was sacrificed for short-term efficiency.

These tariffs, crude as they may be, are part of a supply-side reawakening. They’re not about punishment—they’re about leverage. They force the conversation about what should be made at home, what should be traded fairly, and what national independence actually costs.

And yes, some industries will always make sense to import—coffee, for example, or products where climate or culture gives another country a permanent edge. But that doesn’t mean the U.S. or UK can’t adapt. Advanced societies with deep capital markets, engineering talent, and a strong rule of law have no excuse not to compete where it matters.

So no—tariffs aren’t some satanic invention. They’re a tool, like any other. Used poorly, they can be destructive. But used strategically, they can be the first step toward something more resilient.

It’s time we stop confusing the stock market with the economy. And it’s time we stop dismissing every deviation from the status quo as economic suicide. Sometimes, the short-term pain is exactly what long-term strength requires.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1juzisu/forget_ceteris_paribus_the_world_is_not_ending/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1juzisu/forget_ceteris_paribus_the_world_is_not_ending/

2025-04-09 02:34:46,"In-Depth Analysis of EHang: Why I Believe the Future of Low-Altitude Economy Lies Here?—A First-Person Perspective from an Analyst: Moat, Financial Inflection Points, and Valuation Expectations",SensitiveSpecial5177,0,"I also posted this DD in another sub.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CattyInvestors/comments/1juurkb/indepth\_analysis\_of\_ehang\_why\_i\_believe\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CattyInvestors/comments/1juurkb/indepth_analysis_of_ehang_why_i_believe_the/)

I. **Business Advantages**: Why Are the Three Moats in My Eyes Difficult to Shake?

As an analyst tracking the eVTOL track, I have always believed that EHang's moat has not been fully priced by the market. The following is the core logic supporting my judgment:

1.**Resonance between Demand and Policy**: The ""Favorable Timing and Location"" of the Low-altitude Economy

●**Market Size Estimation**: I have observed that the global eVTOL market is expanding at an annualized rate of 45% (from $35 billion in 2025 to $300 billion in 2030), and the policy support in the Chinese market far exceeds expectations. In 2024, the ""Government Work Report"" listed the low-altitude economy as a ""new growth engine"" for the first time, and subsidy policies in local governments such as Guangzhou and Hefei (with a maximum subsidy of 30 million yuan per project) have entered the practical operation stage. This pattern of dual-wheel drive by policy and market leads me to define 2025 as the ""first year of commercialization of the low-altitude economy.""

●**EHang's Positioning Advantage**: While its peers are still struggling with airworthiness certification, EHang has already obtained four major certificates: TC, PC, AC, and OC. This means that while its competitors' products are still being debugged in the laboratory, EHang's EH216-S can already charge for passenger transport in the pilot areas of Hefei and Shenzhen. This time difference brings at least a 2-3 year exclusive period, which is sufficient to capture early high-profit scenarios (such as scenic area sightseeing and high-end commuting).

2.**Technological Iteration**: Breaking through the ""Life and Death Line"" of Endurance and Cost

●**The data of solid-state batteries surprised me**: In November 2024, the EH216-S equipped with the battery from the Hefei Research Institute had an endurance of 48 minutes (a 60% increase compared to the original model), and the test team privately revealed that the target of the third-generation battery to be mass-produced in 2025 is directly 60 minutes. This means that a single flight can cover the straight-line distance from Shanghai Pudong to Hongqiao (37 kilometers), which may open up the imagination space of Urban Air Mobility (UAM).

●**The evidence of cost reduction in the supply chain**: The motor jointly developed with Zhuhai Enpower is expected to reduce the cost of the power system by 20%. In my research, I found that the unit cost of EHang in 2024 has dropped from 1.8 million yuan to 1.55 million yuan. With the commissioning of the automated production line (the second phase of the Yunfu base), the cost is expected to be reduced to below 1.4 million yuan in 2025, which is crucial for the overall gross profit margin to return to 65%.

3.**Production Capacity and Orders**: From ""Telling Stories"" to ""Real Delivery""

●**The delivery data refutes the doubters**: EHang delivered 78 aircraft in Q4 2024 (a year-on-year increase of 239%), and the annual delivery of 216 aircraft far exceeded the market's initial expectation of 150 aircraft at the beginning of the year. More importantly, the order structure has shifted from government pilot projects to commercial customers. Xiangyuan Culture and Tourism signed a contract for 200 aircraft at one time for scenic area operation, and the sightseeing projects in multiple cities have generated stable cash flow.

●**The production capacity layout reveals ambition**: I have visited the Yunfu base on the spot, and the debugging progress of its automated assembly line is one month faster than expected. After the production capacity of 1,000 aircraft is realized in 2025, with the regional coverage of the Hefei/Weihai bases, EHang is fully capable of increasing the delivery volume to 3,000 aircraft within 2 years, which will be 3 times the current market consensus.

II. **Financial Verification**: Why Do I Think the Profit Inflection Point Has Arrived?

Facing the financial report data, the market is always torn about the ""GAAP loss"", but my model shows that the non-GAAP profit is the real signal:

**Revenue Explosion**: eVTOL Has Transformed from a ""PPT"" to a ""Money Printer""

●In the company's revenue of 456 million yuan in 2024, Q4 accounted for 36% (164 million yuan), verifying the effect of production capacity ramping up. According to the current delivery rhythm, I estimate that the revenue in Q1 2025 will exceed 200 million yuan (a month-on-month increase of 22%). The annual guidance of 900 million yuan is on the conservative side. And now that the OC certificate has been approved as scheduled, it shows that the revenue from operation services is feasible. Assuming that the annual revenue per aircraft is 2 million yuan, if it can cover 3,000 scenic areas (5 aircraft per scenic area), the potential scale of operation revenue is about 30 billion yuan, which will open up the second growth curve.

2. **The Mystery of Gross Profit Margin**: Short-term Pain, Long-term Brightness

●Many people are worried about the decline of the gross profit margin from 64.1% to 61.4%, but when I disassembled the cost structure, I found that the one-time investment in the airworthiness modification of EH216-S has pushed up the unit cost, and this factor will be eliminated in Q2 2025. More importantly, the gross profit margin of operation services can be as high as 75% (only 58% for hardware). As the proportion of service revenue increases from 5% to 20%, the overall gross profit margin may return to over 65% by the end of 2025.

3. **Cash Generation Ability**: An Underestimated Survival Chip

●EHang's operating cash flow has been positive for 5 consecutive quarters, and the cash on hand of 1.155 billion yuan is sufficient to cover 3 years of R&D investment. Compared with Joby Aviation, which burns money at an astonishing speed (an annual loss of $400 million), EHang's ""self-cash generation"" ability makes me think highly of its risk resistance.

III. **Valuation Divergence**: Where Exactly Is the Market Wrong?

Currently, EHang's market value corresponds to a PS of only 15 times in 2025, while that of its peer Joby is as high as 69 times. This huge disparity puzzled me until I discovered two major cognitive differences:

1.**The Market Underestimates China's Policy Execution Ability**

Overseas investors have difficulty understanding the promotion speed of the ""Chinese low-altitude economy"". Shenzhen has built the world's first city-level low-altitude dispatching system, and Hefei plans to lay out 500 takeoff and landing points in 2025. The implementation of these infrastructure projects will directly increase the utilization rate of eVTOL, while their counterparts in Europe and the United States are still arguing with the FAA about the regulatory framework.

2.**The Revenue from Operation Services Has Not Been Priced**

The current valuation only reflects hardware sales, but EHang is piloting a ""profit-sharing model"" in scenic areas such as the Dabie Mountains (a 30% commission on each flight revenue). If this model works, the proportion of operation revenue will exceed 20% in 2025, and the valuation system will shift to that of a SaaS company (8-10 times PS), which means at least a 50% room for correction.

IV. **Risk Warnings**: The Three Major Risk Points I Closely Track

Although I am optimistic in the long term, I do not shy away from risks. The following are the variables that may subvert the logic:

1.**The Mass Production of Solid-state Batteries Is Delayed**: The technical route of the Hefei Research Institute has not been tested in winter low temperatures. If it cannot be mass-produced in Q3 2025, the endurance advantage will be diluted.

2.**Local Government Debt Drags Down Infrastructure Construction**: The construction of low-altitude takeoff and landing points depends on government investment. If the fiscal policy is tightened, it may lead to lower-than-expected implementation of scenarios.

3.**Intensified Competition**: The entry of international competitors such as Joby (PS 69 times) and domestic competitors such as XPeng Aeroht (with pre-sales exceeding 3,000 aircraft) may squeeze market share and affect the valuation premium.

**Conclusion**: My Positioning Strategy and Key Nodes

As an analyst with a heavy position in EHang, my operation logic is very clear:

●**In the short term**: The approval of the OC certificate (Q1 2025) and the delivery volume in Q1 (target of more than 200 aircraft) are the catalysts for the stock price. If the stock price falls below the 20-day moving average, reduce the position periodically.

●**In the long term**: Hold until the end of 2025. The target price corresponds to a PS of 8 times in 2026 (revenue of 2 billion yuan), and the expected upside is 120%.

**Finally, a reminder**: eVTOL is not a short-term speculation concept, and one needs to endure the fluctuations of policy and technological iteration. But if you believe that the urban sky will eventually be reshaped, EHang may be the sharpest spear in the next decade.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1juvf3n/indepth_analysis_of_ehang_why_i_believe_the/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1juvf3n/indepth_analysis_of_ehang_why_i_believe_the/

2025-04-08 23:53:33,I don't think you guys understand how bad shit is going to get...sell now,blueorangan,0,"**This is NOT a drill, folks.**

We’re all hearing the news about COVID-19 spreading quickly, and now countries are starting to implement lockdowns. I’m not sure if everyone fully understands just how much this is going to affect the global economy, but we’re about to see a chain reaction that could send the stock market into freefall.

Here’s why I think the worst is still ahead of us:

1. **Lockdowns Are Going to Crush Businesses** Businesses everywhere are already starting to feel the strain. We’re talking about massive industries grinding to a halt, retail stores closing their doors, restaurants shuttering indefinitely, and airlines cutting flights. This isn’t just a temporary slowdown – lockdowns will stop economic activity for an indefinite amount of time. If this goes on for months, there’s no way the stock market can keep up. When companies start reporting losses, investors will panic, and the selling will begin. Expect major corrections, or worse.
2. **Unemployment Is About to Skyrocket** With businesses forced to close their doors, people are going to lose jobs. The service industry, retail, and entertainment sectors will be hit hardest. Once this happens, consumer confidence will plummet, and spending will slow to a crawl. People won’t be buying as much, and businesses won’t be able to recover. This is a recipe for disaster, and it’s hard to imagine the stock market staying afloat when millions of people are suddenly out of work.
3. **The Stock Market Is Overvalued and Fragile** Let’s face it – the stock market has been on an unsustainable upward trajectory for years. Investors have been riding high on the expectation of steady growth, but now reality is setting in. Once the full scope of the pandemic hits, markets will react. We could be looking at the worst crash since the 2008 financial crisis. The economy is about to go into a tailspin, and the stock market doesn’t stand a chance.
4. **Long-Term Economic Recession** It’s not just a temporary dip in the market. Once the dust settles, we’re looking at a long-term economic slowdown. The global economy relies on constant movement – constant production and consumption. If that stops, it’ll take years to recover. And let’s not forget, governments can’t just keep printing money forever without inflation catching up. We could see hyperinflation, followed by another round of economic pain for the average consumer.

**I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but now is the time to start preparing for a rough ride ahead.** If you’ve got money tied up in the stock market, I’d seriously consider whether you want to ride out this coming crash. The world is about to change in ways we can’t predict, but we know one thing for sure: the stock market is going to be hit HARD.

Please don’t ignore this. Be smart, plan ahead, and be ready for the worst.

I am 29 years old, married with 1 dependent. Monthly expenses are $6600. Yearly income of around $180k Have about $2000-$2800 left to invest every month

401K ($14k)- contributing 6% which my employer matches 100%, 100% allocated to VOO.

Roth Ira, I have been maxing it for the past few years and have about $36k mostly allocated to VOO.

Taxable Brokerage - $3000 - random funds.

The goal i have is to allocate it between SCHD/JEPI/O/VOO/QQQM.

2025-04-08 18:37:25,Portfolio Rebalancing / Allocation Strategies,FreedomIsMyRight,1,"Afternoon All,

I (56m) rebalanced my company sponsored (Merrill Lynch managed) portfolio in late January.  Overall portfolio at the time was a bit heavy with conservative investments (bonds, stable value, etc.) - probably around a 60% conservative / 40% aggressive balance.

After rebalancing, I shifted a bit to a more aggressive (55% stocks / equities, 35% stable value and 10% bonds) portfolio.  I have “ridden the current wave” and, to this point, have been hit to the tune of a (6%) loss since rebalancing.

Although results over the 6 years will ultimately be the determining factor, my plan was to retire at 62.  Currently, I have been thinking that I would continue investing as my allocation currently sits with the mindset that, while I do understand that we have probably not “hit bottom”, I would be buying at a reduced amount if nothing else.  However, I am also thinking perhaps my overall portfolio should include more bonds.  A few questions I have - would appreciate your thoughts / guidance on:

1:  is my 35% stable value plus 10% bond allocation (together) “conservative enough” given my age?  Should I have more allocated to bonds and less to stable value?

2.  If I proceeded with a rebalance at this time, concerned I would be selling my stocks / equities at a loss.  Would it be better to try and weather the storm before rebalancing or pull the trigger now?

3.  Would it make sense to consider a full portfolio rebalance to target date fund (say 2030 or 2035)?  I have not ever included TDF’s in my portfolio and the common thinking is that this is an “all or nothing” approach from most folks…assuming if this would be a good approach that the 2035 would be more aggressive at this time while the 2030 would probably be an even blend aggressive to conservative and continue in the conservative direction.  While “protecting the house” is certainly a concern at my age, I don’t want to get involved in a fund that doesn’t let me recoup the bit I have taken by being too conservative.

Long read and truly appreciate your thoughts.

Thank you!

2025-04-08 17:02:15,Thoughts on ETFs focusing on the Far East?,RoronoaZorro,2,"So, I have been browsing numerous different ETFs with all sorts of specifics, and when browsing Asian ETFs I realised there are none that quite offer what I would consider intriguing as a small position.

Eventually, I stumbled upon a few ""Far East"" ETFs and thought their composition (or the one of one in particular) was quite interesting.  
It offers China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea & Singapore alongside Thailand, Indonesia & Malaysia.

So, really, apart from India & maybe Vietnam, those are arguably all of the Asian (ex-Japan) countries that people might expect to have high sustained growth potential going forward alongside the some of the more established ""safer"" bets.

So, I'm wondering - what do you think about this? What do you think about this ETF?  
If you wanted to get involved with Asia, which countries would you like to see represented instead & what do you generally expect from Asia/these regions going forward?

ETF in question:

ISIN: LU2439119236

Disclaimer: I will **not** buy this ETF, and that's decided, regardless of what gets commented here. Between the small size,the high TER & the general uncertainty around large parts of S/SE Asia, it's a clear no from me, even for a small position.  
Still interested in your thoughts, though.

My reasoning is the tariffs will rise the inflation again. Fed might have to raise rates let alone cut them. If this happens the stock market will crash (though might be limited after down a lot) and US bond rates will rise. When rates are up, bonds prices go down hence shorting them will make money.

So from my understanding, the fund can only fail if enough people default on their deals, which means everyone in the fund gets a bunch of real estate for a forclosure cost basis

Most of the people i know, people worth millions, just use this fund instead of the stock market. 

Any red flags i’m missing here?

I have been avoiding investing for a couple of years now because of lack of money, but now i have a lot to spare, and i was wondering if investing in the S&P 500 would be a good call now. 

My living situation is steady as can be, i have a job and decent savings (around 6k$).

My thinking is that the stock market is experiencing a shock due to the tariffs, but i've also seen the S&P 500 being a general profit if you look at the last year or longer. This means from what i've gathered, that now is a good time because the economy will stabilise with time and adjustment.

On the other hand, i have a feeling that the US is on its way out as a leading capitalist nation as China are getting more and more advanced.

28M, married, no kids yet (planning soon). Own a home with 25% down and a $590k mortgage. Also bought a $350k apartment for my parents (no loan).

I’m a singer in the music business, so income is inconsistent, but usually between $200–300k/year depending on how songs perform.

Grew up very poor, so I have money trauma and constant fear of messing it all up — just trying to be smart and not lose what I’ve built.

OG POST 
I’ve been sitting on $500,000 in cash since early 2020. When the COVID crash happened, I froze. I thought I’d wait for a “clear bottom” or more certainty.
Then the recovery took off… and I missed it.

Fast forward to today:
	•	Markets have rebounded hard
	•	Inflation, interest rates, AI boom, and global instability all make me hesitate
	•	I’m still just sitting here with half a million dollars, unsure of the “right” move

Here’s what’s holding me back:
	•	I don’t want to buy in at the top
	•	I worry about inflation eating my cash
	•	I’m tired of trying to time the market — but scared of going all in
	•	I’d love passive growth, but also safety

I’m not looking for a magic answer, just real talk:
	•	What would you do if you were in my shoes right now?
	•	Is DCA still the best path?
	•	Where do you see long-term opportunity in this market?

Anyone else who sat out 2020 and still feels stuck, I’d love to hear your mindset — or how you finally made a move.

2025-04-08 14:04:02,My analysis of the market,wolley_dratsum,0,"Since last summer, I’ve been posting monthly updates over at a subreddit I created, r/investorinsights, mostly as a way to step back and see the market more clearly.

For a while, those updates were pretty uneventful—because, frankly, the market was behaving. But with all the recent volatility, I think there’s more value in sharing the research I’ve been doing. So I figured I’d post the April update here for anyone who might find it helpful.


**InvestorInsights April 2025 Update**

Market Volatility: A Gut Check, Not a Crisis

The S&P 500 is down quite a bit from its February high, finishing March at 5,811.85. That puts us right back where we were last July—like a roller coaster that forgot how to climb. The Nasdaq Composite has taken an even bigger hit, down 14% since December.

This kind of pullback isn’t new, and it’s not the end of the world. In fact, it’s part of the natural cycle. What's especially notable is the $7 trillion sitting in money market accounts right now. That’s a massive amount of capital sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a clearer signal to re-enter. History suggests much of it eventually will.

If you’re already invested, the best move may be to simply keep going. Timing the market is a losing game.

Economic Signals: A Mixed Bag

There’s plenty of conflicting data out there. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting -0.5% GDP growth for Q1—technically a contraction—while the New York Fed is estimating +2.9%. That’s a massive spread, and it reflects just how uncertain this environment is.

That said, reacting to short-term data with long-term money rarely ends well. A sound financial plan is designed to weather both good quarters and bad ones.

Trucking and Rail: Positive Movement

In more encouraging news, the American Trucking Associations’ Tonnage Index rose 3% in February. Trucking moves over 70% of the goods in the U.S., so when tonnage rises, it's a sign of life. Rail traffic is also up 4.2% year-to-date, with intermodal shipments climbing 8.2%.

That tells us that goods are moving and commerce is flowing—both good signs beneath the market noise.

Housing Market: Under Pressure

The housing sector continues to face challenges. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to 39 in March—its lowest in seven months. Builder sentiment is being weighed down by rising material costs (including tariffs that add an estimated $9,200 per home) and ongoing policy uncertainty.

The Northeast is the most resilient region, but elsewhere, construction is slowing. If you’re looking to buy or build, it might be wise to exercise patience.

Inflation: Still Sticky

Inflation remains persistent. Core PCE, the Fed’s preferred metric, was up 2.8% year-over-year in February. Short-term interest rates are now north of 3%, which is starting to bite into borrowing and spending.

But this isn’t a 1970s-style runaway inflation scenario. Prices are still rising, yes—but they’re rising more slowly, and the Fed is keeping a close eye on the trend.

Federal Reserve: Staying the Course

The Fed kept interest rates steady last month at 4.25%–4.5% and is slowing the pace of balance sheet reduction starting in April. This suggests they’re aiming for a “soft landing”—bringing inflation down without tipping the economy into recession.

It’s a tricky balance, but so far, they’re not rocking the boat too much.

Final Word: Stay Disciplined

Headlines will always focus on the drama—but don’t let noise drive your decisions. Downturns are a normal part of investing, and history consistently rewards those who stay the course.

Think of this moment like a sale on high-quality assets. If you’re still in the accumulation phase, market dips aren’t something to fear—they’re opportunities.

Ten years from now, today’s turbulence will be a blip in your rearview mirror. Focus on what you can control: your savings rate, your asset allocation, and your mindset.

In a 6 month span Mithaq was able to significantly cut back on operating expenses and increase gross margins resulting in PLCE becoming profitable again.

Childrens Place announced preliminary Q4 data in December 2024 where it noted that there was a 3.4% increase in sales from prior year same quarter. This would suggested a Q4 revenue of $470m, significantly beating estimates of 390m. The shares popped on this news to $14 and Childrens Place announced a offering. Mithaq Capital acquired more shares in February 2025 and did a offering to existing shareholders. Mithaq increased its ownership from 54% to 62% during this capital raise at $9.75 which at the time was a 30% discount to current market value. These funds were used to pay down long term debt. Mithaqs average cost base on their 14m shares owned is around $11.50.

**Q4 Earnings March 11, 2025 After Close - Why a Buyout is Coming**

Childrens Place will be reporting its Q4 earnings after close this Friday. Here is what to expect:

Preliminary data for Q4 showed a 3.4% increase in net sales from prior year.  
  
Revenue estimate:  
  
24Q4:470M  
23Q4:455M  
  
With 470M sales quarter then it should have operating income close to 45-50m for Q4 while trading at a market cap 120m. of This is under the assumption same gross margin and only a 5% increase in operational expenses which is in line with previous quarters.

**Guidance** \- I expect a significant jump in guidance for FY 2025.

Web Traffic is showing a 40%-50% increase year over year when looking at January to March. (150k visitors vs 112k)Expecting sales guidance to be in the 1.7B range at the minimum. They have also partnered with Shein last October and are actively selling on Shein's store front - to date over 300k sales orders have been recorded on that store front in 6 months.

**Why I expect a buyout-**

**1) Company Updates and Board/Management Changes -** the company has gone dark on giving us updates since they did the capital raise in December. Historically PLCE announced preliminary numbers and net income the first week of February. Childrens Place has also not made any announcements since the share offering and has had substantial changes in Board/CFO/Management which is all very common when a buyout is coming from a majority holder.

**2) Tariffs are a great thing** \-owns $500m of inventory as of year end. These tariffs essentially increase the value of that inventory by 40%. As the price hikes will be passed to customers and all current inventory has already seen prices inflated for these increase in expected costs. Mithaq is essentially getting a $200m premium on the purchase.

**3)Current Price** \- PLCE is trading at $6.32 and is at a 6 month low. Mithaq's current cost base is roughly $11.50 per share. Mithaq can low ball a offer of $10 a share and still give current premium of 58% to current shareholders.

**4)Earnings Timing -** never reported earnings on a Friday after close - even last May when they knew they were going to have a record loss year. Childrens Place is also not have a earnings call rather a letter to shareholders on Friday after close which all buyouts occur through this method.

**5)Taking Private -** Mithaq acquiring the remaining 8m shares would allow them to take this company private at a total cost of around 225m (22m shares - average $10-11). I expected Mithaq to take Childrens place public again sometime in 2026-2027 after PLCE has a full year of 30-50m net income quarters,

**TLDR:**  
PLCE - Budget kids clothing store has gone through significant changes during 2024 when Mithaq Capital acquired 54% of the company at the start of February 2024. Mithaq cut waste/closed loss generating stores and has turned the company around from losing 28M a quarter to net income of 29M over a 9 month period. Mithaq increased its holdings to 64% at the start of 2025 and since then PLCE has gone dark with business updates and changed majority of its management team. Earnings are Friday after close and all estimates point to a blow out based on December store sales growth year over year + 40% increase in traffic. No earnings call is taking place only a letter to shareholders which has never happened historically. PLCE is trading at a 60% discount to where it was last quarter and my best guess is Mithaq is going to offer a buyout in the $11-12 range for the remaining 8M shares and take the company private. Worst case is no buyout and you are holding a company that is significantly undervalued to its peers and will beat on earnings.

I’m currently invested quite heavily invested a Legal & General Global Technology Index Fund, which is heavily weighted in US technology stocks. I’m confident that this fund will perform well in the long term, and am well aware that right now is a fantastic opportunity to buy if you’re looking for a long term investment.

Has anyone here gone through a similar situation or have any recommendations for a 5-year investment portfolio? Would you stick with equities like tech, or do you think a more diversified portfolio (maybe with bonds or REITs) would be safer in this timeframe?

2025-04-08 09:42:53,"Stop repeating the ""50% loss requires 100% gain"" thing, it's not that insightful",VladStopStalking,875,"I’m getting fed up with people parroting the line ""if you lose 50%, you need to gain 100% to break even"" as if it revealed something important about risk. It’s a misleading way to think about how markets work, and those people seem to imply that it's somehow more unlikely for stocks to go back to their previous value after a drop? Otherwise I don't really understand why they keep repeating this line.

Markets move multiplicatively, not additively. Stock prices follow something close to geometric Brownian motion, a random walk **on a log scale**. In a multiplicative world, the symmetry is between ratios, not percent changes.

Assuming no drift, if you look at a stock price **on a log scale**, you will notice that the probability of a green candle and the probability of a red candle of the same size are equal. A 2x gain and a 0.5x loss are symmetric. A -50% drop and a +100% gain are equal and opposite **on a log scale**. Same for -20% and +25% or whatever other example you want to use.

And if you assume even a small positive drift, which reflects long-term market behavior, then the probability of doubling actually becomes **greater** than that of halving.

If a stock lost 50% due to some unexpected bad news, but it later turned out that the news was entirely fake, the price would go back to its original value i.e. +100%. It would not just gain back +50%.

There's nothing deep or meaningful about saying that you need +100% to compensate for -50%. That's just pointing out a basic fact of math and how percentages work, but it's pretty useless to keep repeating this as if it had a deep meaning.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ju9mmd/stop_repeating_the_50_loss_requires_100_gain/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ju9mmd/stop_repeating_the_50_loss_requires_100_gain/

2025-04-08 08:24:00,Is it just me or is anyone else concerned that China will threaten to invade Taiwan?,OppenheimerAltman,0,"Is it just me, or is anyone else concerned that China might threaten to invade Taiwan to posture a response to the Trump tariffs?

With the trade war heating up and neither side backing down, pressure is definitely getting to both sides. The People’s Bank of China just set the midpoint rate for the onshore yuan at 7.2038 per dollar—the weakest level since September 2023. Could this force China to start playing their hand? As a last attempt to regain leverage, couldn’t they just threaten Taiwan?

We already have the Ukraine-Russia war dragging on, which Trump claimed he’d resolve on day one—but hasn’t. There’s still an escalating conflict between Israel and Gaza, and now the U.S. is hinting at bombing Iran if a new nuclear deal isn’t reached.

On top of that, the general outlook on tariffs is rattling Wall Street. CEOs who once backed Trump—like Elon and Bill Ackman—are now publicly opposing the tariffs. If China plays the Taiwan card and threatens the global tech and AI supply chain, couldn’t that send the U.S. economy into shambles?

At the end of the day, it’s about who holds the cards right. Trump may believe China will fold under economic pressure—but what if they don’t? What if China bluffs and leverages the U.S. stock market’s vulnerability, or worse, disrupts AI sentiment through Taiwan’s semiconductor production?

2025-04-08 05:32:25,How China’s Restrictions on Rare Earth Mineral Exports would Affect the EV Industry,kmmeow1,6,"China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, notably tightened as of April 4, 2025, are poised to significantly impact the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for the high-performance magnets in EV motors, while elements like lanthanum are used in batteries. China controls roughly 60-70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it a chokehold on the supply chain that the U.S. EV sector heavily relies on.
The immediate effect is supply disruption. The U.S. imports about 74% of its rare earths from China (down from 80% a decade ago), and with export controls escalating—starting with gallium, germanium, and graphite in 2023 and expanding to other rare earths in 2024 and 2025—manufacturers like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford could face shortages. A single EV motor can require 1-2 kilograms of rare earth magnets, and with U.S. EV sales projected to hit 1.5-2 million units annually by 2030, the demand for these materials is massive. Without a steady supply, production lines could slow or halt, delaying deliveries and driving up costs.
Cost increases are already in motion. Post-restriction price spikes have historical precedent: in 2011, when China cut exports, rare earth prices soared—neodymium hit $67,000 per metric ton. Recent data shows neodymium at $75,097 per metric ton and dysprosium up 4.65% to $250.60 per kilogram as of late 2024, with analysts expecting further climbs in 2025 due to these bans. EVs already use six times more minerals than conventional cars, and with graphite (another restricted mineral) being the largest component in battery anodes (up to 136 pounds per EV), battery prices could jump 18% or more, pushing sticker prices higher and potentially slowing consumer adoption.
Geopolitical leverage amplifies the strain. China’s moves are a response to U.S. tariffs and tech curbs, like the Biden administration’s December 2024 semiconductor export limits. With 90% of heavy rare earths (like dysprosium, critical for EV motor heat resistance) processed in China, a full ban could cripple production timelines. The U.S. has only one active rare earth mine—Mountain Pass in California—producing 15% of global supply, but it lacks sufficient domestic processing capacity. MP Materials, the operator, ships much of its output to China for refining, and its Fort Worth magnet facility won’t be fully online until late 2025 at earliest.
Mitigation efforts are underway but slow. The U.S. is investing in domestic supply chains—Biden’s 2021 Executive Order 14017 and the Inflation Reduction Act pump millions into mining and recycling—but scaling up takes years. Alternatives like Australia (10% of global supply) or Vietnam exist, but their output is dwarfed by China’s, and processing still often routes through Chinese facilities. Recycling could offset 30% of future rare earth demand, yet only 1% is currently recycled in the U.S. Tesla’s shift away from rare earths in next-gen motors is promising, but it’s not yet scalable across the industry.
The EV industry faces a triple hit: delayed production, higher costs, and strategic vulnerability. A total graphite ban alone could slash EV output, given China’s 77% share of natural graphite and 95% of synthetic graphite production. Add rare earth curbs, and the U.S. could lose ground in the global EV race, with economic losses estimated at $3.4 billion in GDP from just gallium and germanium restrictions. Without rapid diversification or innovation, China’s restrictions could stall America’s electric dreams.

2025-04-08 02:21:30,A Tariff impact I had not thought of... China ignores patents,Dies2much,1655,"One of the ideas I saw today was pretty messed up: what happens if China just ignores patent protections and starts making copies of American products?  Medical devices, car parts, farm equipment, thousands of other things that they had been playing ball on so they could stay on the good side of the US.  Well the US just threw that all away, so now China is not bound by anything, they can just copy anything they want, slap their label on it, and sell it at their price, and full quality.

  
If Chinese companies do this, it would be a further wedge between the US and China, and a substantial problem down the road if a rapprochement was tried.

  
The drug companies are most at risk on this one IMO.

2025-04-08 02:16:45,Maintaining Sanity When Someone Screams Fire! What to learn from Charli and Warren.,Silent_Mistake758,1,"**Maintaining Sanity in Market Madness: The Art of Clear Thinking When Others Panic**

In the unpredictable world of financial markets, perhaps the most valuable asset isn't found in any portfolio but resides within ourselves: a clear, disciplined mind. When markets become volatile and participants succumb to collective panic, the ability to maintain rational thought becomes not just advantageous but essential. As the saying goes, ""The mind is the ultimate measure of the man,"" and surrendering one's rational thinking, even momentarily, can lead to devastating financial consequences. While there is no perfect solution to the psychological challenges of investing, there are practical approaches that can serve as anchors during turbulent times.

* The Foundation: Know What You Own

The first principle of maintaining mental clarity in chaotic markets is surprisingly simple yet frequently overlooked: know precisely what you own and why you own it. More importantly, write it down. This documentation process serves multiple purposes. It forces clarity of thought at the time of purchase, creating a record uncontaminated by future market movements or emotional states. When markets plunge and fear takes hold, these written records become invaluable reference points, reminding us of the rational analysis that led to our decisions.

This documentation need not be complex—a simple statement of the business fundamentals, competitive advantages, and your thesis for ownership suffices. The act of writing crystallizes thought and creates a touchstone to return to when markets test your resolve. Without this anchor, investors often find themselves adrift in a sea of market opinions, unable to distinguish between sound reasoning and fear-driven reactions

* The Microscope Over the Telescope: Focus on Business, Not Economics

The second principle challenges conventional wisdom: forget macro economics. While economic forecasts make for interesting reading and discussion, they rarely translate into actionable investment insights. Instead, keep your attention fixed on the businesses you own and only on them. This narrow focus is not ignorance but discipline.

Great companies navigate through various economic cycles, often emerging stronger from downturns as weaker competitors falter. By concentrating on company-specific metrics—cash flow, competitive positioning, management quality, and growth prospects—investors insulate themselves from the noise of economic predictions that often prove wrong. The question isn't whether GDP will grow by 2% or 3%, but whether your businesses' competitive advantages remain intact and their long-term prospects sound.

* The Golden Rule: Time as the Ultimate Multiplier

Perhaps the most powerful principle is the recognition that ""Money is made in owning great businesses for long periods."" This golden rule stands in stark contrast to the frenetic trading that often characterizes market behavior during volatile periods. The compounding effect of high returns on capital over decades creates wealth that short-term trading simply cannot match.

This perspective transforms how we view market downturns. Rather than threats, they become opportunities to acquire more ownership in excellent businesses at favorable prices. The investor who understands this principle sees volatility not as something to fear but as the very mechanism that creates opportunity. Without the occasional panic, premium businesses would rarely become available at reasonable prices.

* The Psychology of Serenity: Avoiding Imagined Troubles

The fourth principle addresses the psychological dimension of investing: don't suffer imagined troubles. Mark Twain famously said, ""I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened."" In investing, this wisdom is particularly relevant. Markets constantly present potential catastrophes to worry about, most of which never materialize or prove far less severe than feared.

The discipline of distinguishing between actual business problems and theoretical market concerns is crucial. Has something fundamentally changed in your business, or are prices simply reflecting temporary uncertainty? This distinction helps prevent the costly mistake of selling quality assets during market panics, only to repurchase them at higher prices when confidence returns.

* The Balanced Life: Investment as a Component, Not the Whole

The final principle extends beyond investing itself: get another hobby and don't forget to live life. Investing should be an important but not all-consuming activity. Those who allow market movements to dominate their thoughts and emotions inevitably make poorer decisions. The investor who maintains outside interests and perspective can step back from market turbulence with greater ease. Gardening is my balast and its a hobby I'd reccomend!

This balance serves a practical purpose beyond just quality of life. Distance from the daily noise of markets often leads to clearer thinking about long-term value. Many of history's most successful investors are known not for their frenetic activity but for their patience and ability to ignore short-term market movements in favor of long-term business outcomes.

# The Integrated Approach

These five principles work together as a system rather than isolated tactics. The investor who knows what they own and why, focuses on business fundamentals rather than economic predictions, understands the power of long-term ownership, avoids imagined troubles, and maintains life balance possesses a formidable psychological advantage.

In practice, this approach might mean reviewing your written investment theses during market declines rather than market commentary. It might mean turning off financial news during volatile periods to focus instead on the quarterly reports of businesses you own. It certainly means resisting the urge to make major portfolio changes based on short-term market movements or economic predictions.

# Conclusion

In the final analysis, the investor who maintains their composure when others lose theirs not only preserves capital but positions themselves to capitalize on the opportunities that market dislocations invariably create. Perhaps that is the ultimate advantage: the ability to act rationally when rationality is in shortest supply.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ju2vhp/maintaining_sanity_when_someone_screams_fire_what/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ju2vhp/maintaining_sanity_when_someone_screams_fire_what/

2025-04-07 20:01:42,Don't like how our broker treated us,Fun-Ad-5784,0,"I think he is a broker. He handles our investments in a large investment company. We decided we wanted to pull our investments because we are seriously worried about them as they are literally our only savings. Our broker tried talking to us and saying he's been in the business a long  time and he's seen this before in 2022 and etc but we are really worried about a tariff war and recession/depression. We would be totally cool with letting the money sit in the bank and not make money rather than lose it. I've lost 5k since Friday. Yes things will get better but how long will it take and how low will we go and how many years to recover before making a profit again? I had a really good year last year but the new government down south will be in power for 4 years and this is the only money we have. Mom is retired and I work but not much above minimum wage. 

He got very upset, aggressive (i felt) and angry almost. He said it was his job to help us make the right decision and this was the wrong decision. That he is telling us, like everyone is being told, to be patient and wait, things will get back to normal. He said when it comes to investing there are two types of people, those who are afraid and those that are greedy. I didn't like him putting it as greed vs fear, though i agree with the fear. My mom was terrified about losing the money and she has bad nerves. We look back and think my brother pressured us to invest because getting lump of money was too tempting and could easily be blown. My mom is not the investing type. She's 79, should she really be playing the long game? 

To compromise i said I'd keep my investments going and she can take.hers but he was still pushing pushing pushing. Talking about trends and blah, blah, blah. 
He said mom's investment is low risk and that she only lost 1% and if she invested 50k or 1m it would still be 1% but if she cashed 1m less 1% she would had a heck of a lot more money than 1% of 50k (he investment is closer to the 50k definitely not the 1m) and 1% of 50k would hurt a hell of a lot more so I don't think his comparison is valid.

I don't like how pushy he was. Even if it's a bad decision investment wise, it's still our money and our decision. We agreed to wait a week and he seemed happy. He sould not be happy or angry or disappointed, this is business but I know it affects him with his income (how exactly I'm not sure but I'm sure it does). He wanted us to Google to see what experts are saying and read and think and i think we are more convinced we aren't comfortable with him. I can totally see him going to my brother since he recommended him and he's like next of kin to take over if mom dies.  
I don't know if i trust the media as i see how biased they are. Can I trust the news to tell me the truth? Are business experts trying to keep the market from getting worse with people like us wanting to take our money and run? If the tariff war is going to lead to a recession would the news or the experts really tell us before it's too late?

Okay, so I'm from Brazil and have a very promising startup. Everyone I talk to, including potential investors, says it's a great idea, has a solid business plan and potential. However, when I say I'm located in Brazil, people from other countries say it's too big of a risk since we are so far away and they don't understand the legal side of my country.

I could look for an investor from my own country, however, I need 80.000 dollars, which in Brazil is waaaay more difficult to come by because of the currency's high conversion rate.

**What can I do?** I've thought about some possible workarounds:

* Sign a contract that establishes the law to be followed is from the investor's country of origin;
* Offer more equity because of the risk involved;
* Having an international manager from the start.

But even with this, it's been very tough to find someone who agrees to invest. 

I know the product is not the issue. My idea is validated, I have a large list of leads, social media followers, an MVP with overwhelmingly positive feedback, and very experienced founders. I know my idea is great, but I can't find someone who both has the capital and agrees to invest in a different country.

My clients are all from other countries, my pricing is in dollars, and my branding and communication are all in english. The only thing Brazilian about my pitch are the founders (CEO, CFO, and CTO).

What else can I do? What would convince you to invest in a startup like this?

I see trump crashing the stock market as a push for demand of treasury bonds. A higher price on bonds pushes for lower interest rates on bonds which tend to push borrowing costs down for the government and companies. This usually happens when the market goes down as well.

I did take out about 1k in long term investments last year before the election. I usually stick to the set it and forget it method but I figured stocks were pretty high and I was under the impression that with my income I would have no long term capital gains tax so I was taking a bit of a gamble. Since I might not be in this tax bracket for long. 
I also cashed out some long term loser stocks mostly because they were gamble stocks I bought when I was young and my portfolio was a bit too crowded but I figured even if I got taxed on some of the long term capital gains I could offset with some of the loses. 
I used H&R Block and was already charged extra for filing my investments. 
I purposely paid extra toward my federal income every month just because last year I owed money come tax season. Based off my last years taxes I should have gotten back at least 1k-1400 with the extra money I payed every paycheck instead I only got back 300
I’m a little upset. 
Basically my question is was there something I was supposed to do other than give H&R Block my vanguard documents, it said it guaranteed a maximum return. I made sure when I cashed out my investments I used fifo so I don’t know why I owed the irs $1000 more this year than last? That was basically 100% of what I cashed out which obviously isn’t how capital gains would work in any tax bracket? Is it just that this year everyone paid more taxes?

It’s a little stale now, especially with things changing so fast, but I would still like to have the conversation.

I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, let me jump right to the question for you:

Will the negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's stock enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

\---------------------------------------

For those looking for something to read, here you go:

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain.

Here is a great interview with the well-respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those who do not want to watch the whole video, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".

1. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends.

1. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*

1. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.

1. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession.

1. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us).

1. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the ""little guy"" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices.

1. America is a consumer-based economy (\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is ""no tomorrow"". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.

1. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).

1. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business have very long time-cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.

1. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.

1. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. This will cause more market volatility.

1. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is ""half done"" in his view.

One thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administration’s haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.

I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more ""TLDR"" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out as being far more likely to be of great benefit to China in both the near term and long run. Not America.

Back to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a ""possibility"" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:

6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR) (\*a lot has changed in the three days since I made this chart/post).

While the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from its recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the ""Trump Bump"" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and ""meh"" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen any *real* damage to its share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon!

I know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: ""*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*"" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as ""Tesler"". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF).

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised his voters that he would do.

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the rosiest picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself).

If there is real and lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers (Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future) boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow.

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost (and counting). While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a Band-Aid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time.

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla.

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

2025-04-07 16:01:15,The current state of the stock market and how to think about your personal way forward,elinordash,44,"I know a lot of people are freaking out right now about the stock market.  

Moments like this are why the stock market is meant for long term investing.  You can lose money in the short term.  Your emergency fund should not be in the stock market. Moments like this are also why people close to retirement should not be all in on stocks (unless they have another source of income like a pension).  

Selling locks in losses.  In some situations, locking in those losses might be the right plan.  In a lot of situations, holding on to the shares is the wiser strategy. If you have 20+ years until retirement, you have plenty of time for your shares to rebound.  But if you see yourself definitely needing some of the invested money in the next five years, you may want to make a different choice.

Target Date Funds are popular for retirement accounts because they are designed to be less volatile due to their mix of US, international, and bonds.  They also become less risky the closer they get to the expected retirement age.  Right now, VOO is down 15% since the beginning of the year.  Vanguard 2040 is down less than 8% and Vanguard 2060 is down less than 10%.  More conservative options are less volatile.  

VOO and chill is very big on Reddit, but while VOO is down 15%, VXUS is down less than 5%.  You might want to consider the [Bogleheads strategy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started) which also has its own subreddit.  If you currently have high risk investments, one option is to let those ride, but change how you invest new money.  Meaning let your VOO position ride while adding in VXUS and BND (or whatever you choose).

*Out of 1,034 stocks traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), a total of 945, including contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), fell by the maximum 10 percent amid concerns that the tariffs could undermine global trade, dealers added.*

*The Taiex, the TWSE's benchmark weighted index, ended down 2,065.87 points, or 9.7 percent, at 19,232.35 after moving between 19,212.02 and 20,153.57.*

*It was the first time the index had closed below the 20,000-point mark since Aug. 5, 2024, when it ended at 19,830.88.*

*Monday's losses were the steepest ever in the Taiex's history, smashing the previous record of 1,807.21 also seen on Aug. 5, 2024, when disappointing U.S. data prompted investors to worry about the economy.*

**Despite the sell-off, turnover on the local market totaled only NT$147.295 billion (US$4.44 billion), the lowest single day total in more than two years.**

**""The low turnover showed many investors were reluctant to buy the dip as they expect more losses to follow due to the tariff shocks,"" Mega International Investment Services analyst Alex Huang said.**

*On April 2, Trump announced a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from most countries, with the exception of Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus, starting April 5.*

*Countries with larger trade surpluses with the U.S. will face higher tariffs starting April 9, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (26 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (37 percent).*

*China took retaliatory action soon after Trump's newest move.*

*""The 32 percent tariff Taiwan faces went beyond what the market had expected, in particular after TSMC pledged (in March) to pour an additional US$100 billion into Arizona in support of Trump's advocacy for investment in the U.S. market,"" Huang said.*

*TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock here, plunged 10 percent to close at NT$848.00, contributing more than 750 points to the Taiex's decline and contributing to a 9.71 percent decline in the electronics index.*

**""Orders to sell an additional 68 million TSMC shares failed to find buyers today. More selling will follow after the market opens tomorrow as investors fear Trump's tariffs will boost inflation and lead to a recession,"" Huang said.**

…

*Huang said non-tech heavyweights also came under heavy pressure, pushing the Taiex down further.*

*""There are few signs of any immediate rebound as the Taiex, which resumed trading today after the last session on April 2, needs to incur more losses to match global volatility,"" Huang said. ""So a similar trading pattern is likely for tomorrow.""*

*Measures to curb short selling were put in place before trading Monday and will remain in effect through Friday in a bid to calm the market, though it made little impact Monday.*

2025-04-07 10:56:43,Are the tariffs the real problem or just a reality check?,Creepy_Artichoke_479,0,"Disclaimer: not an American and I have little interest in politics, my question/opinion is solely a financial one.

So everyone is blaming Trump for the recent drop in the stock market, and losing them money, and yes, if you look at the small picture this is due to the tariffs.

But this also contradicts something that people constantly say. ""Time in the market beats timing the market"" (implying that the stock market should average out and trend up over time, so it's better to slowly invest over time you should be better off).

If we read this and agree, then it seems we have nothing to worry about, because $600 ($SPY as an example) was the true value based on fundamentals and the economy over all, then eventually it will reach that price again.

But I think the big issue is that it should never have been valued that high. After COVID, which was a legitimate reason for a drop in the markets worldwide, the US Government (or the Federal Reserve which acts independently to the elected Government I believe) printed off and invested trillions and trillions of dollars into the stock market, and also gave out money, which a lot of bored people used to invest in the stock market.

This, and the coinciding tech boom caused by people working from home and being at home more often, created a generation of people who think that the stock market is an unlimited money glitch which only ever goes up with absolutely no consequences, and now they are shocked that it isn't the case after all.

So while Trump's tariffs kicked off this recent drop, is it something that has been coming for a long time and is way overdue? Had it not happened, and the market value had continued to increase, would it not be even more severe when something else caused a sell-off?

After all, if $600 is the true value of $SPY then should it not quickly recover as it's now so obviously undervalued. So while this may be self inflicted, and cannot be compared to the drop due to COVID, is it completely irrelevant to the true issue at hand, which is a bubble that was going to burst eventually?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jtig36/are_the_tariffs_the_real_problem_or_just_a/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jtig36/are_the_tariffs_the_real_problem_or_just_a/

1) 8% - 1.39% = 6.61% rate of return after the withholding tax

2) 100% (representing the entire 8% rate of return) - 1.39% = 98.61%

98.61% of 8% = 7.9833% rate of return after the withholding tax

2025-04-07 07:30:49,Lets play the call the bottom game 2025 edition!,wander9077,64,"SO there are no fabulous prizes other than maybe trying to catch a falling knife but lets put forth our best estimates of where the bottom could be.  If possible be sure to include your reasoning.  Here is my guess:

So the S&P was at 6144 on Feb 19th then we had the first Tariff shock and it sank roughly to 5500 (in part bouncing off 10% correction and then going back to about 5600-5700 range).  At that time Goldman Sachs noted consensus was the tariff announcement in early April would yield about 8% so the market was priced about right going into April 2nd (about 8% down from peak).  Then we had the announcement with a weighted average of about 24% tariff across all trading partners (JP Morgan numbers)  rather that the 8% the market expected.  If it were only that simple then we could reasonably expect the pricing in to be 24% below the 6144 peak or around another 14% down from the 5500 short term bottom before the april 2 announcement.  That number is about S&P 4700. 

BUT the market also now knows atleast some countries / regions will enact tariffs of there own in response although not all will.  This stands to further cause impact but remember they also clearly realize that reprisal tariffs hurt there own companies as much as they hurt the US also, the German, Spanish, Italian finance ministers have even voiced this since the announcement .  SO Im going to guess they take a more modest approach on average across all trading partners.  Im going to guess they do what the market expected the US to do in the first place which is a consensus of 8%.  So that takes 4700 down by another 8% to just around 4300.   If they were to do 10% instead then that would be more like 4200.   The S&P was trading at around 24 P:E on april 2, income will ofcourse dip going forward but the trailing P:E would be reduced to about 18.  It could easily overshoot but im sticking to my guess of **4300** what is everyone elses best guess.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jtfmoq/lets_play_the_call_the_bottom_game_2025_edition/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jtfmoq/lets_play_the_call_the_bottom_game_2025_edition/

2025-04-07 03:36:21,Should I Invest $10K From a 0% APR Credit Card Into Index Funds? (Unemployed Right Now),Muslim_conservative,0,"
Hey all,

I'm considering doing something a bit risky and wanted some honest feedback.

I have a 0% APR credit card with a $10,000 limit and an 18-month promotional period before interest kicks in. I was thinking: what if I invest that $10K into a broad index fund like VOO or SPY?

The logic is that the market *usually* trends up over time, and I could walk away with a few hundred to a few thousand in profit before paying off the card — assuming I sell and repay the balance before the 0% period ends.

Here’s the catch:  
**I'm currently unemployed.** No steady income right now, though I’m working on it. I don’t have any major debt, and I’ve got a small emergency fund — but not enough to cover the full $10K if the market tanks.

Also — does anyone know which **brokerages are safest** when using a credit card for funding? Or is that not even an option? I’ve used Fidelity and Schwab before with bank transfers, but I’m not sure how this would work with a credit card.

I know this is a gamble and not for the faint of heart. But I’ve heard stories of people using 0% cards strategically, and I’m wondering if this could be one of those situations… or just plain reckless given my current status.

**Any thoughts or advice?** Would love to hear from anyone who’s tried something similar.

Like month two, if there was no change, I would add another $50. If the money went down to say $45, I would have had to have added $55. If the account was at $57, I would have added $53. 

So each month, I had to see what month it was, where I should be, and how much to add.

But as far as I can tell, Fidelity does not offer self funded Roth IRA while it looks like Chase does. Chase is also where I bank personally and throng my LLC, so would Chase be a better option? Or should I split the 401k into Fidelity and Roth IRA with Chase? Anyone who’s under similar setup can offer so advice?

Recently, I locked into a model that changed the game for me:

Think +2 | Feel –2 | Act 0

Think +2:
Operate like you’re two orders of magnitude above your current level.
If you’re at 6 figures, think like a 8-figure investor. See through the lens of legacy, scalability, long-term structural advantage. Ask: Would someone managing $10M even flinch at this? What do they focus on instead?

Feel –2:
Train your nervous system to respond like you’re two orders of magnitude below.
$5K swing? Act like it was $50. The goal is emotional inoculation—investing from strategy, not fear. No dopamine hits, no panic dips. Just a monk with a Bloomberg terminal.

Act 0:
Execute based on where you actually are. Proportional moves. Reality-based risk management. You don’t YOLO like you’re broke, but you don’t freeze like you’re Warren Buffett either. You’re present, precise, and sharp.

⸻

This formula keeps me from micromanaging, catastrophizing, or getting delusional. It gives me:
	•	Perspective (from +2)
	•	Emotional control (from –2)
	•	Tactical clarity (from 0)

2025-04-06 17:49:46,Sanity Check - No Dry Powder - use Margin in liue of Dry Powder?,ai0verlords,0,"TDLR: Does having dry powder by selling stocks and paying a guaranteed 15% capital gains tax now ($37.5k) cost roughly the same as borrowing via margin at 5% interest over 3 years ($30k)?  
\--

Hey Reddit, quick sanity check needed on my post-crash thinking. I didnt sell at the peak like Buffet. But my sour-grapes thought is, at least i didnt incur cap-gains 15%, then I extended it thinking ok, so what if I use margin strategically and pretend its dry powder? (Robinhood margin is \~6%). Not worried about Margin call - i have other assets to liquidate to pay for margin calls, i want to **STAY invested**, hence this plan.

**Assumptions for this hypothesis:**  
\- market will recover in 3-5years.  
\- will keep dip buying slowly as the knife falls till midterm elections (nov 26).

**The Numbers:**

* Lets say Portfolio: Was $1M, now \~$750k (down 25%).
* Peak Unrealized Gain: \~$250k (if I had sold).

**Scenario 1: Selling Peak (The Road Not Taken)**

* Sell $1M, realize $250k gain.
* Pay \~15% long-term cap gains tax = **$37,500**.
* Net cash proceeds = $962,500.

**Scenario 2: Stay Invested + Margin (The Current Plan)**

* Current position: $750k (no tax paid).
* Plan: Add **$100k-200k via margin @ 5%-6%** annual interest over 2 years (5-10k a month).
* Hold time assumption: **3 years**.

**The Trade-Off / My Logic:**

Is avoiding a definite **$37.5k tax hit** (by not selling) worth using **$200k margin** now, which costs **\~$30k-$36k in interest** over 3 years (5% of $200k \* 3)?

**Break-Even Point:**

* To make holding + margin ""better"" than selling + paying tax, my gains need to cover the avoided tax plus the margin interest.
* Target gain needed = $37.5k (tax) + $30k (interest) = **\~$67.5k**.
* That's roughly a **9% gain** on my original $750k over 3 years, *just to match* the cost comparison (doesn't include recovering the $250k loss).

Margin Sources:  
\- Robinhood at 5.75% for 3 years (limit 7m)  
\- 4% CC offers 50K for 12 months (will tap into this first as it has lower apr)

Is comparing the avoided tax ($37.5k) to margin interest ($36k) a cope or strategic? :) I get to STAY INVESTED in market, and pay 5% annual penalty for my inaction at peak.   
  
Example Portfolio $1M -> $750k (-25%). Didn't sell peak & realize $250k gain (would've paid $37.5k tax). Now thinking $200k margin @ 5% (\~$30k interest/3yr). Is avoiding $37.5k tax worth the $30k+ interest & risk of margin? Need \~9% gain just to cover that trade-off. Thats just 3% gain per year. Thoughts?

The goal is to be able to retire at or a little after 55. Some quick numbers...

Gross pay $9,400/month (I have several deductions in my paychecks like TDA/city tax/union fees....)

TDA balance: $107K (I contribute $1232/month; max contribution for the year is $23K)

Roth IRA: $10K (I contribute $1,200/year; max contribution is $7K)

My main question is **where should I be investing more of my money to?** Should I be putting more in my Roth/maxing it out and then putting more towards my TDA?

2025-04-06 14:05:07,Is it possible to invest in stock markets outside my own country? [Fidelity],Parker_Talks,0,"Hello,

Please bare with me here because I’m not entirely sure how to phrase this question and this may be a bit rambley as a result. (Sorry if this seems simplistic to some people. I’m 23 and not exactly familiar with the stock market. I was just thrust into it in 2022 when I suddenly inherited a bunch of stocks but I didn’t really do much with it until relatively recently.)


So, I have an IRA investment account with Fidelity. I inherited it with a lot of money but mostly into individual stocks. Obviously, the US stock market is crashing right now, and investing into mutual funds which include companies that will be affected by the tariffs feels like not the best move for me personally. That is the prior info needed for my question. 

I guess basically what I’m trying to ask is, is it possible to invest in mutual funds within stock markets outside the US? Like, can I, as someone living in the US, use my Fidelity account to invest in a mutual fund that exclusively deals with companies that aren’t US based and won’t be affected by the tariffs directly? For example, could I access the London stock exchange? Would it be possible to use the money in my account for that? Or is my account somehow tied to the American market? 

[Apologies if this shouldn’t be its own post. I’m new to this subreddit and not entirely sure on what exactly the rule on what should be an individual post exactly means. ]

Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, just now gave George Stephanopoulos an example illustrating how tariffs could benefit consumers:

Kevin’s example:

• A small business (SMB) sells 100 apples at $1 per apple.

• Then, a 10% tariff is introduced.

• If the supplier raises prices, consumers purchase 10% fewer apples.

• Kevin explained, “So what is the small business going to do with these 10 apples? They don’t want to eat them, so they’ll lower the price.”

Implication:

The Trump administration expects the real burden of tariffs to fall on the small businesses themselves.

Unspoken consequence:

What Kevin Hassett did not mention is that the small business may go bankrupt, resulting in all of its employees being laid off.

These people are idiots..

yeah...almost nobody really studies emotions - let alone our own.

Emotional mastery is key to all things...but ""logical"" people miss the boat entirely. I've been there.

Oh yeah...caffeine suppresses our emotions until it can't.

  
Understanding your emotions and how they've been manipulated by larger forces (semi-hidden) may improve your financial performance.

I could go further on what I mean by ""hidden"" larger forces...but we'll wait another decade for that.

as most people, I am in shock of the policies of this administration and I feel like we are certainly heading into a recession. I am posting to get some feedback and other people's opinion on my thought process. I, of course, don't have a crystal ball but I feel like many people are too relaxed as it somehow all worked out relatively problem free the last few dips/drops and people feel like they get the same company for a better price. I don't think that is the case as the E part of the P/E ratio will not be the same considering the changes in the supply chain and in consumer sentiment. Also, trust has been destroyed.

IF my thoughts are correct, big IF, I know, I think it would be rational to sit this out for a while even if I have to enter at higher prices when we have a reasonable economic policy or a reasonable president. I feel like this is not market timing. Market timing is, of course, difficult. It is just weighing current upside vs downside risk.

I have been very happy with my portfolio, it consists of companies that should all not be affected by tariffs in theory, but in practice, they unfortunately are as they will be sold off with everything else and also their earnings will drop in a general recession. Even V sold off.

The increased buybacks will not be able to make up for all the losses. I am young and would have loved to stay invested for decades and I will again do that when this nonsense is over but I don't feel I need to sit this one out. I would not be hit with taxes as all the gains of two years have been lost. I feel like I have gotten good prices and did not overpay for them but still they willl be sold off.

2025-04-06 03:18:59,"To the ""line always goes up"" folks: why?",notchatgptipromise,0,"The response I see most often is that this is based on population growth, especially in the US, since we have a very interesting lever other countries don't (or at least, not as much) which is immigration. Basically, open the doors a bit more, let in more folks, add more to the GDP, etc. I could get behind that, but I don't think it's a *given*. 

So if you believe in the ""always goes up eventually"" mantra, DCA right now, sure. But why is the fundamental assumption true for you? Or, is there another one I'm missing? 

I guess the pushback here is obvious, it's just a question of how likely you think it is: current policies become more restrictive/extended -> the US is no longer a desirable destination for economic immigrants -> population growth and GDP slows -> line doesn't always go up. I realize this is overly simplistic, but to me so is the assumption that we can sit back on population growth as assurance that eventually, the overall market always goes up and to the right. 

As I'm writing this, maybe one pushback to my pushback is that sure, this net influx may decrease, but the market for US goods abroad will still increase over time. Though that's worth challenging as well: several factors could impact global population rise and certainly global disposable income.

My thesis is that the market will continue to go down significantly over the next few months to years but will eventually rebound.

I had been stockpiling cash since trumps election predicting some global destabilizing economic event would take place and now have a small lump sum ready to deploy. Because I think the market will go much further but eventually rebound I’ve set orders as a trailing stop purchase for XGRO by 3%, with the understanding that the purchase order won’t activate until the equity rises 3% below its lowest point. 

My thought process is that this will decrease the likely hood that I’ll purchase at far “too high” of a price in exchange for the fact that I’ll purchase at least 3% above the lowest point.

I think selling when there's blood in the streets is a panic decision, and the stated purpose of our portfolio (long term wealth building) is unchanged. I think using some of our ""dry powder"" to buy during the Trump turmoil might work out well. 

She trusts the stock market very little, preferring tangible investments like real estate. I see it as one of the few viable roads to long term wealth (along with the house we own). 

I can't deny that echoes of Hawley-Smoot, the Great Depression, and the possibility of a constitutional crisis have me rattled too. I just don't want to make a snap, panic decision.

So: are any of you selling? What's your plan to re-enter the market? If you're holding, why?

I have been going back and forth on this for a bit now, but especially after what’s been happening I thought I would ask.

I use Betterment as my platform for basically everything—checking, HYSA, investing account, Roth IRA. I just happen to like it that way—keeps me invested on a regular basis for DCA purposes. I am 24 y/o and would like to continue investing on a recurring basis. Nevertheless they have TLH, but for my tax bracket which is 12% ($62K/yr salary), this recommendation to not turn TLH on appears:

“TLH+ is not usually beneficial for individuals in your federal tax bracket of 12%. Once TLH+ is turned on (1) Avoid trading in any of the ETFs in the Betterment portfolio in other accounts. (2) Turn it off if you plan on liquidating the majority of your taxable account in under a year. Be aware of your portfolio strategies. Electing different portfolio strategies for multiple goals may reduce opportunities for Tax Loss Harvesting.”

So because of my salary and 12% tax bracket, they do not recommend TLH. Do I abide by this or turn it on regardless? Is there harm to having TLH on for me specifically?

You then miraculously hold out until the current bottom of $5074 and decide to put your $100,000 back in, feeling like a genius. 

If the S and P 500 eventually recovers back to $6100, you made.... 20% extra return! Great. Let's not even consider potential dividends you missed out on by not being invested. 

That is $20 000 extra you made out with. Sounds like a lot, but really, it's not. You are not going to become a millionaire or be able to retire early off of a maneuvor like this. You need to CONTINUE with absolute perfect market timing to keep compounding these returns over time. Each time, you need to correctly time your SELL and also your BUY back in. 

The VAST majority of people cannot consistently do this and beat the benchmark over the long term. You might have a couple perfect trades, that give you some meager gains. But over the long term, you are going to mess up and miss time some HUGE gains by not being invested in the market. And all those taxes, trading commissions, and missed dividends we ignored during the single trade example, are sure as hell going to add up over the long term.

Markets go up. Markets go down. That’s just how it works. The problem is most people say they want to invest, but what they actually want is a risk-free lottery ticket. The moment things stop going up in a straight line, everyone freaks out.

But this isn’t unexpected. This is the game.

You’re supposed to prepare for moments like these — not be surprised by them.

Look at Warren Buffett. He’s sitting on $350 billion in cash right now. Not because he’s scared — but because he’s patient. He’s waiting to buy when others are selling in fear.

Most people:
	•	Invest emotionally
	•	React to headlines
	•	Forget about cycles
	•	Expect linear growth

But if you zoom out, you’ll see that every dip — every crash — has been followed by recovery. Long-term investors win because they don’t flinch.

If you’re investing for the next 10, 20, 30 years… a red day, week, or even year isn’t a signal to panic. It’s a time to stay focused, stay consistent, and if you can — buy more.

This can't be farther from the truth.

To understand what's happening, we need to look at the government maturing debt in the next 30 years. 

An unusual load of debt must be refinanced just in the next few years during this administration.  

You would need two things to do that, (1) a load of cash, and (2) low interest rates. 

Slapping tariffs would do exactly that: (1) bringing a load of cash to the government, (2) causing the money in equity market to panic and escape to the treasuries which will cause the interest rates to drop.

Icing on the cake would be if Powell capitulates and lowers the funds rate ""because"" we might enter a recession.

As you can see, this is more of an emergency measure for a near term problem, something that has to be done if the country doesn't want to default and destroy the dollar.

So the thinking that the government is going to negotiate with China to remove the tariffs is completely flawed. The administration needs this money.

2025-04-05 13:54:55,What is the argument for not putting a large down payment on a house?,insertcleverSNhere,50,"Obviously the current house market is a lil off and there are higher interest rates in the past (let’s call it 6 percent). If you are in the market for a 500k house and you have 400k in wealth, why would you not put 300k on the house? This leaves the 100k safety net/entertainment money accessible . This scenario can assume this average person is already saving well for retirement.

What is the argument to only putting 20% down and keeping the rest liquid.

The mortgage rates are higher than a high yield savings, so seems like that is not an option. 

The market is generally scary (Especially this week…but that’s another argument) so getting consistent returns of >6 percent seems like risk/reward isn’t there. 

Positive argument would be having a large amount of cash liquid to enjoy the money more, invest, or buy toys. 

I know this is subjective but even the most general explanation is fine.

Late last year I finally committed to creating some structure and adding diversification to my 401a and IRA (my Roth still holds a handful of individual stocks). I'm targeting 60% VTI, 20% VXUS, and 20% VXF and rebalancing every quarter. After the way things have gone this year I was about 3% overweight on foreign and eager to rebalance on 4/1 to capitalize on the discount we've had on US stocks. So I did, obviously knowing that Liberation Day was coming but that it was also a crap shoot (I assumed the tarrifs were priced in). Afterward, I'm obviously regretting not waiting to rebalance but trying to convince myself that I still got a discount and that there was no guarantee it would go the way it did. In the future should I still be as rigid in rebalancing? I'm an IT professional so having a logical plan feels right to me, for no other reason than to take out the emotion (even though it's still there).",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1js3mbd/rebalancing_my_portfolio_this_quarter_stung/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1js3mbd/rebalancing_my_portfolio_this_quarter_stung/

I became increasingly concerned with capital protection because of all the supply chain issues and geopolitical tension. I looked around for something more conservative to ride out the uncertainty and I landed on the Permanent Portfolio. Sure, I missed out on some slight gains than if I had stayed 60/40, but the peace of mind was worth more.

I'm not saying to invest in the Permanent Portfolio necessarily, but I am using it as a shield during uncertainty and it has worked out well every single time. I switched from 60/40 to the PP before the election and gave myself 6 months to switch back to 60/40. Holy crap, I'm actually up quite a bit since November, '24 on account of gold skyrocketing. I still plan to return to 60/40 at the 6 month mark, but I think I'm down like 2% this past week. I sleep like a baby with this portfolio.

Eventually when the economy recovers, we’d have bought into the market at a discount. But how often are you DCA-ing? Weekly? Monthly? Bi-monthly?

If you DCA too frequently, you will rack up transaction fees. And if the dip lasts longer than expected, you may run out of cash to continue DCA-ing before the dip hits its lowest.

If you DCA too infrequently though (maybe bi-monthly), then if the market somehow recovers within 2 months, you’d have missed the opportunity to buy the dip.

Looking at past market crashes and how long they took to recover may inform us of how often to schedule an investment, but they vary so much. 1929 great depression took 25 years to reach its ATH, 2000 dot com bubble took 15 years to reach its ATH, 2007 housing crisis took 4.5 years to reach its ATH, 2020 covid crash took 5 months to reach its ATH.

So, how are you guys planning to schedule your DCA, and how much are you investing per DCA investment, such that you can maximize your odds of having enough cash to continue investing at the lowest of lows?

When markets are going up, investing is EASY: You buy VOO and chill—at least that's what people on this app do. When we see a correction, everyone starts losing their minds. The reality is that investing HAS been figured out. You buy low-cost, globally diversified ETFs and wait. Hold through the good times and wait through the bad times. The truth is that a lot of you can't do it. There is a reason why retail has vastly underperformed the S&P 500 over the last 20 years... even though we have seen maybe the greatest bull run in the history of the world. People here love telling others that a financial advisor is a huge waste of money. Guess what, advisors outperform retail investors by over 2% annualized WITH a 1% advisory fee. That 1% fee does compound to a ridiculous amount of money over multiple decades, but who cares, you are gonna panic sell anyway and then FOMO back in when there's a bounce. 

STAY THE COURSE. Fund managers get paid millions, literally millions of dollars every year attempting to outperform the S&P 500... and they are unable to do it. Keep buying low-cost, broadly diversified ETFs. Or hire an advisor who also invests in low-cost ETFs for their clients. STOP SABOTAGING YOUR RETURNS.

2025-04-05 00:25:49,Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era,cheese_and_toasted,1,"Elon Musk’s ventures have long dominated “space investing” conversations – but with Musk’s recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn’t publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \~$10–11B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn’t: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let’s break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:

* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab’s financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They’ve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .
* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab’s next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer – Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts. If successful, Neutron opens a much larger addressable market (national security launches, interplanetary missions, even crewed flights eventually). Investors are watching this closely; any positive development (engine tests, on-time construction) could boost the stock. In the meantime, Rocket Lab isn’t waiting around: they’ve signed new launch deals (e.g. an 8-launch contract with Japan’s iQPS just announced) , and they delivered on missions like launching 8 satellites for OroraTech with just 4 months’ turnaround , showcasing operational excellence.
* Government and Commercial Tailwinds: Unlike many space SPACs and startups that struggled, Rocket Lab has real customers and repeat business. Their backlog is \~$1.1B , split \~50/50 between government and commercial clients – providing diversification. Notably, Rocket Lab was selected for the U.S. Space Force’s NSSL Phase 3 (Lane 1) program , making them eligible for missions under a $5.6B launch contract umbrella alongside incumbents like SpaceX and ULA. They also hold a $515M contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to build missile-tracking satellite systems . These wins not only validate Rocket Lab’s technology in the eyes of key customers, but also ensure a baseline of revenue in coming years. In essence, Rocket Lab is aligning itself as a core player in future government space infrastructure – a recurring revenue stream that many “new space” companies lack.
* Musk Factor – or Lack Thereof: From an investing standpoint, one could argue that Musk has become a risk factor. Tesla’s own 10-K warned that the brand is tied to Musk’s reputation , and indeed we’ve seen political backlash contribute to Tesla’s sales slump and stock drop . SpaceX, while successful, is privately funded and also influenced by Musk’s persona (which might carry regulatory or public image risks, given his role in government and polarizing public statements). Rocket Lab provides a “Musk-free” exposure to the space sector. CEO Peter Beck is an engineer-executive who keeps a lower profile. There’s no cult of personality driving Rocket Lab’s valuation – which means less idiosyncratic risk. In fact, Rocket Lab’s shares are more directly correlated with its execution (launch success, contracts, revenue) than with any social media narrative. For an investor, that can be reassuring.

Valuation Considerations: After the recent pullback, RKLB trades at a more reasonable multiple relative to its growth. It had skyrocketed over 400% in the past year , but is now off highs. Analysts still see upside: Cantor Fitzgerald recently reaffirmed an Overweight with a $24 target , and other targets range up to $33 . Clearly, expectations are that Rocket Lab will continue to scale and eventually approach profitability as Neutron comes into service. Risks include execution delays (a short-seller argued Neutron could be late to 2026 , which would slow revenue growth) and competition (SpaceX’s dominance, emerging players like Blue Origin). However, Rocket Lab’s head start in small launch and established customer base give it a moat in its niche. Its enterprise value ($11B) is a fraction of SpaceX’s ($140B private valuation), so investors are essentially betting that Rocket Lab can capture even a small slice of SpaceX’s market share in the coming years – which would justify significant upside.

Conclusion: If you’re disillusioned with Musk or simply want a piece of the space sector’s growth, Rocket Lab is one of the most compelling options available. It combines the innovation of New Space with the accountability of a public company. As always, invest based on your due diligence (space is a risky industry), but RKLB offers a balanced risk-reward profile: solid current business, big future bets, and freedom from the Elon factor. For many, that’s an attractive proposition in 2025 and beyond.

I could live with that.

The VIX, is at 46 “fear gauge,” is at 6, For context, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, fear was a 9 

Historically, when the VIX exceeds 25, it often signals prime buying opportunities. In fact, every instance of the VIX surpassing this threshold has been followed by significant market rebounds.

All the negative factors projected tariffs, absence of deals, and lack of tax cuts are currently being priced into the market. None of these have materialized yet. Similarly, no positive developments have occurred, except for the trillions of investments flowing into our country. Any hint of a deal or policy shift could ignite a strong rally.

I’m no market oracle, so I’m taking a measured approach by DCA into positions. And anyone here who claims to be one is mistaken because the future is uncertain. Notably, two prominent hedge fund managers initiated new positions in NVDA today. Why? Because, despite the unpredictability of policy decisions, they recognize the value in NVDA at $100. Reflecting on 2022, we experienced several dead cat bounces until the bottom was reached in October.

Reviewing my purchases from 2022: ￼
	•	1/24: 50 shares at $393
	•	2/4: 10 shares at $409
	•	3/8: 5 shares at $383
	•	5/23: 20 shares at $360

	•	9/13: 10 shares at $361
	•	10/17: 10 shares at $335
	•	12/7: 4 shares at $361

As you can see, I was down pretty bad all year but remained consistent. I own four ETFs, and even if this market declines another 90%, I will still be okay.

Remember, the best opportunities often arise when fear peaks. While others hesitate, this could be the moment to consider buying.

I'm wondering if i should put it into very low risk so it doesn't grow but doesn't shrink or if I should pull it and leave it in the bank until things improve. 

Yes things will eventually get better but what if it takes 10 years? The money will drop and when it finally starts to grow it will have to recoup all that lost money just to break even and that could take years. I'd rather leave it safe and not get gains rather than lose money.

The Dow pulled back 5.5% to enter into correction territory. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (GSPC) sank nearly 6%, as the broad-based benchmark capped its worst week since 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 5.8% to close in bear market territory.

The major averages added to Thursday's $2.5 trillion wipeout after China said it will impose additional tariffs of 34% on all US products from April 10 — matching the extra 34% duties imposed by Trump on Wednesday.

That ramped up investor worries that countries are more likely to retaliate than negotiate, leading to a protracted global trade war.

Investors flocked to government bonds as the 10-year Treasury (TNX) yield fell to 3.9%, nearing its lowest levels since October.

Economists are warning that with tariffs as-is, the risk of a US recession is rising. The monthly jobs report, unusually overshadowed Friday, showed a labor market that held steady ahead of Trump's biggest tariffs. The US added 228,000 jobs in March, beating estimates, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%.

Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Powell for the first time addressed the reality of the tariffs, saying they were ""higher than anticipated."" He said it is ""too soon to say"" what the proper rate path should be. Traders have ramped up bets on interest rate cuts this year to five, as the Fed is expected to set its efforts to cool inflation aside to tackle the bigger risk of economic slowdown.

Trump, posting on Truth Social on Friday, added to fears by saying that his policies ""will never change"" and warning that China ""played it wrong.""

So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, just move on. 

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain. 

Here is a great interview with the well respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those with short attention spans, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".
2. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends. 
3. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*  
4. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.
5. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession. 
6. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us). 
7. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the ""little guy"" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices. 
8. America is a consumer-based economy (\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is ""no tomorrow"". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.
9. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).
10. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business has very long time cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.
11. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.
12. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. 
13. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is ""half done"" in his view. 

One thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administrations haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.

\*I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more ""TLDR"" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out, as far more likely to be of great benefit China in both the near term and long run. Not America.

Back to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a ""possibility"" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:

6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR)

While the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from it's recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the ""Trump Bump"" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and ""meh"" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen an *real* damage to it's share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon! 

I know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: ""*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. He is going to build a car in 5-seconds. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*"" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. Fact: It is physically impossible to build an entire car in 5-seconds because of physics (Newton's Second Law applies here: F=ma). It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as ""Tesler"". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF).

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised voters that he would do. He will have to pick between his voters and Elon soon enough. 

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.   

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the most rosy picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself). But if there is real lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers, Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future, boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.  

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow. 

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost- and counting. While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a bandaid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time. 

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla. 

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

I'm a buy and hold person, I only sell if any of below 3 conditions are met:  
1) I need extra cash for unexpected events  
2) Fundamentals of the company I bought has changed  
3) Assumption that US will continue to grow and be a global economic leader

Mostly due to #3, I have not sold at all for the last \~8 years and only bought more during dips, including covid crash. While I'll most likely be buying more again if we see further dip from here due to tariff wars and a possible recession/depression, I'd be lying if I say I haven't questioned #3 in the past couple of weeks.

What do you all think? Even if this orangutan cancels all tariffs going forward, I'm curious if US will have the ability to regain its trust globally until at least the next election (and let's please hope we get a better president elected by then, not this 3rd term nonsense).

	•	Investment Strategy: I plan to invest using Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), dividing my $375 monthly investment across my portfolio.
	•	Investment Allocation: I would like to allocate around 60% of my investments to the apartment (which belongs to my family, so I cannot liquidate it until they decide to sell).

Dabbled in some Int'l ETFs / Europe Defense trade - but took some small losses when those trades reversed in the last week or two.

Now < 1% equity positions - for old time's sake. < 5% gold

I'm up for the year < 1% more or less (Multi-6 figure portfolio USD). My performance is nothing to write home about...but the moral of the story:

I realize time in the market is the leading recommendation than timing the market with investing. 

The crap that’s happening is pretty ridiculous! Don’t get me started on the current Administration policies! I also realize that this downturn is definitely not as bad as the previous downturns, YET! 

However, this has the potential of being up there with the worst downturns pretty soon if this continues! I know my numbers will pale in comparison to many others that have 6 or 7 digit losses in the last 1 month. 

I have read countless posts, articles, and books about how time in the market is better than timing the market. So, it’s been drilled into my brain to stick out the bad times because it will turn around. 

It is so frustrating right now (I know I know I’m not the only one). I have lost over 35k in the past month (once again I know that’s Pennies for some folks). However, it took 3 years to gain that 35k only to be wiped out in 1 month!! It is really hard to see those losses so quickly! 

It’s so hard to get over the fact that; what if I had sold everything a month ago and weathered the storm on the sidelines?

Also, here is a great question/observation: what is the core/simplest reason why the market is dumping? 

Answer: a ton of folks/institutions are SELLING! So, why is it so ingrained that time in the market is better than timing the market. If that was the case, we wouldn’t see these drastic selloffs, right? It seems like not many folks are following this consensus!

My broker is XTB, which takes a 0.5% conversion fee between usd and euro.

I'm not an EU or US citizen, and I plan to invest long term 20+ years, with monthly contributions.

From my calculations, I'd probably come out on top investing in [SPYL.DE](http://SPYL.DE), despite the conversion fees, because of its lower TER.

The main factor that could affect my profits would be the Euro/usd exchange rate changing drastically in the future.

Are we risking the Dollar global reserve currency status on tariffs?,Hot-You-7366,405,"Peter Thiel has long been saying globalism was bad in the Clinton era fueling growth in a bad way. To what extent sure, I dont agree with everything Clinton did at the behest of the GOP Senate and House. But sometimes once you do something there is no going back.

Corporations are already flatly saying they cannot (will not) build the infrastructure and find the labor pool to do what the mega manufacturing cities of China and other Asian countries can do even if you tariffed them 1000%.

Thiel (especially for an immigrant) seems fixated on bringing us back to the 1960s, I suggest watching any of his interviews over the last 10 years he says the same every ime any way. He wants innovation in industry and jets for some reason (he always talks about the flight time to London). And, he says it will be bad for a big percentage of the population. At least he doesnt lie about it, a generation or two are gonna get sent to the cleaners.

Who buys american debt in this scenario? Banks wont touch it. Internationals wont touch it, With the tariffs completely screwing up FX and countries use of treasuries to make trade work. Whos buying treasuries when your gonna get smoked on your 4% 10 year when it goes to 1981 18% again?

Please explain how we are not witnessing, unless some rabbit is pulled out of a hat, the death of America Global Capitalism?

edit: for those who dont know Peter Thiel is the billionaire tech investor who is alt right. He funded JD Vances campaigns and employed him at his VC for a non-job, just a fake rubber stamp when JD says hes from VC its bullshit.

edit: Trump also saying today tariffs worked in 1700-1800s lol. America was a back country, poor relative to Europe, barely regional power even in the late 1800s. We want to go back to that? We doing the cotton gin again to make clothes? We got rid of tariffs in 1918 or something so we could income tax the robber barons

2025-04-04 01:26:10,The UN Is Mispricing Demographic Risk in China—Global Macro Investors Should Pay Attention,Mido_Aus,0,"**TL;DR**: The UN projects China’s population decline will be moderate with fertility rebounding over time. But that assumption isn't based on evidence—it's baked into the model itself.  The UN’s “median case” is deeply flawed and the ""Constant Fertility"" and ""80% lower bound series better reflect reality. Given these assumptions, we’re looking at hundreds of millions lost within decades—and potentially up to a billion fewer people by 2100.

# 1. The “Fertility Rebound” Is a Modeling Mirage

The UN assumes global convergence to \~1.8 TFR (total fertility rate), so even countries in freefall are forecast to recover. Not because of policy success, but because the model expects them to.

* China 2025 TFR: 1.02 --> UN 2100 forecast: 1.35

The UN uses a Bayesian framework that tends to average things out. So this forecast isn’t optimized for China’s data, but influenced on a broader, globalized assumption set.

# 2. Marriage Is Collapsing—And Births Will Likely Follow

[In 2024, Chinese marriage registrations fell by 20.5%](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/10/china/china-marriage-registrations-record-low-2024-intl-hnk/index.html)—continuing a long-term decline and hitting the lowest level ever recorded. This is a leading indicator for birth rates.

* **96%** of births in China occur within marriage
* Fewer mariages = Fewer babies

# 3. Urbanization Is Driving Fertility Even Lower

China’s urbanization was 65% in 2023, and is projected exceed 80% by 2050. Fertility in major cities is already very low:

* **Shanghai**: 0.70
* **Beijing**: 0.75

As more people move to cities, the national average is more likely to fall than rise.

# 4. Comparable East Asian societies have even lower rates—and they're still declining.

TFR today:

* **Hong Kong**: 0.77
* **Taiwan**: 0.87
* **Singapore (ethnic Chinese)**: 0.94
* **South Korea**: 0.72 (world’s lowest)
* **Japan**: 1.26 (still falling)

# 5. Pro-Natal Policy Is Largely Ineffective

* [South Korea spent $200B+ since 2006 on fertility incentives.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-04/asia-spending-millions-to-reverse-declining-fertility-rates/103779994) TFR: still 0.72
* Japan has offered child allowances, subsidized care, paid parental leave for 20+ years.

Despite pro-natalist policies, birth rates continue to decline in Japan, South Korea, and across much of Europe.

# 6. The UN Keeps Revising Down

* **2019 UN forecast**: China peaks 2031–2035
* **Actual peak**: 2022
* **2024 revision**: The “base case” is now below the 2022 low-end scenario

**Final Thought**:  
In my opinion, the UN’s 2024 forecast appears to be systemically flawed and I believe their 2026 forecast will be further revised down. I don't claim to have a crystal ball but I think it's worth drawing attention to these figures which are significantly worse than what has been widely reported.

Note: I'm not an economist, statistician or a demographer so take my analysis with a grain of salt.

95 years ago the US levied the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, worldwide tariffs that were designed to encourage domestic production and punish ""cheating countries"". This kicked off a trade war that had no small part in causing a world-wide depression. 

The US has not levied global tariffs of this degree since then. Until yesterday.

What happened to US equities?  After a roaring bull run during which wealth was printed and the every-day man flung money in the market it crashed. But not overnight. In fits and starts the DJI lost 90% of its value over a 3 year period. 

It took *25* years for it to return to an ATH. 

Trump has fired 10s of thousands of federal employees. He's spiking unemployment. He's taxing imports to the tune of 50-100%. Other countries will do the same to us. Our companies will start having mass layoffs, crushing economic activity and investment. Domestic production will not return, everyone one will be out of money to buy stuff anyways. The SH tariffs did nothing to encourage domestic manufacturing, it just made everyone poorer. 

Maybe our monetary policy will prevent a Great Depression and we escape with ""only"" 8-10 percent unemployment, mild stagflation and the market takes 3-5 years to recover after a 50% fall.

I know this isn't a huge loss compared to others but I guess my question is... would it be better to take the remainder out of VOO with all this uncertainty right now and go into something more stable? 

To clarify, I dont mean out of the Roth account entirely and realize the loss... but move to a different investment for now... 

OR... should I DCA VOO while its on sale (and continues to drop)? 

The problem with DCAing right now for me is I can only contribute like $50 or $100 every 2 weeks (per pay period) so I dont know how much of a dent its going to make while all of this is going on.

I underestimated the shock and awe that Trumps tariff reveal looked like a 3rd grade social science project.

I really hate how I was really geared up to anticipate and go more defensive and rebalance defensively with good defensive picks but decided to be like oh the market seems fine in advance of the tariffs.  I shouldn’t go too defensive as it is out of line with my age blah blah blah.  Oh well shoulda coulda. 

The biggest problem I have is when people say well it’s impossible to time the market blah blah. I have to think back and think well not necessarily this was dated and anticipated I just think I felt there was enough staff guard rails to have not ended up in a tariff plan reveal that looked drawn up by crayons.

2025-04-03 20:51:17,“Don’t try to time the market” but hear me out…,Slothandwhale,0,"Been lurking here for a few days to try and figure out how best to proceed in light of recent events. I’m as basic as it gets as far as investing goes. I have a 401k that I’m contributing to at the max level matched by my employer, which is about what I can feasibly afford to set aside. Up until this point I’ve been incredibly hands-off, allowing my contributions to go into a targeted fund which is currently heavily weighted in stocks as I’m still a ways off from retirement.

I generally agree with the overwhelming consensus of this sub that says to not try to time the market and just ignore the news, keep plugging away through the ups and downs yada yada because nobody can truly predict the market.

However (and here’s where I’m sure I’ll be mocked and downvoted), it seems like that conventional wisdom was established *before* we had a president who would do things like announce that he’s going to tank the US stock market on a specific date. That feels like a key factor worth making a small exception to the conventional wisdom, does it not?

Yesterday, I simply moved my current holdings from the targeted fund, into short term bonds (75%) and a money market fund (25%). I’m not married to any of these percentages, that’s just what felt right based on my very limited knowledge. Please chime in if you have a better suggestion. Most importantly, my future contributions will continue to go into the targeted fund buying up these increasingly cheap shares. I’m not running away, I’m just trying to preserve what I’ve already accumulated in the face of certain destruction. 

Now, obviously timing the drop was the easy part, they announced it. And I don’t have near the hubris to think I’ll be able to accurately predict where the bottom is. But I don’t really need to do I? As long as I move everything back in at some point between now and when the market eventually rallies above the position I sold at yesterday, I’ll have ended with more shares than I would have had I just ridden it out. Hell, I could move everything back in right now and I would be *slightly* better off. 

I’m still mulling over how to proceed having mostly avoided this initial drop. I’m thinking of maybe moving it back in 10% at a time over the next few weeks or months rather than try to choose one “ideal” moment. Open to suggestions there. Yes, I know it’s a long game and moves like this are somewhat trivial in the grand scheme of a 30+ year retirement fund but still…Ignoring a blatant certainty that the market is going to tank on a specific day when there are very simple ways to minimize my exposure, just seemed unnecessarily rigid.

2025-04-03 20:16:12,AEC Group needs better strategies to ride on new productive force,budoobudoo,0,"By Peter Chan, Unicorn Analytics

Allied Sustainability and Environmental Consultants Group Limited (“AEC Group”; HKEx stock code: 8320), with rich resources and business connections accumulated since its establishment in 1994, stands a good chance to benefit from opportunities afforded by the new productive force (the “NPF”) trend emerged in recent years. Listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2016, AEC Group focuses on sustainability advisory, environmental impact assessments, energy efficiency solutions, and green building certifications. Though with a long history by Hong Kong’s standards, AEC Group is still a relatively small player in its own turfs. Its pathways towards riding on the NPF trend rest on how it capitalizes on its edges in the industry and connections unavailable to bigger peers.

NPF has been emerging as a forward-looking economic framework gaining traction, particularly in China, emphasizing innovation as the engine of growth. It strives to integrate advanced technologies, namely thought digitalization, artificial intelligence, and green solutions, into different industries to drive high-quality, sustainable development. Key sectors under the NPF banner include renewable energy, smart manufacturing, new materials, and environmental technologies, all underpinned by a global push toward carbon neutrality and resource efficiency.

For AEC Group, whose businesses revolve around environmental consultancy and stewardship, the NPF trend, on face value, presents a good trigger to expand its footprint. Yet successes hinge on how well the Group the opportunities and hurdles effectively.

AEC Group’s service offerings are in good alignment with NPF’s green ethos. As governments and corporations worldwide prioritize sustainability, demand for services like environmental audits and green certifications is surging. The Hong Kong Government’s pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 is a precursor for spurring projects in energy-efficient buildings, low-carbon transport, and renewable energy adoption. On paper, AEC Group’s experience positions it advantageously in guiding clients through this transition, in commissions including providing certifications to high-rise buildings as eco-friendly or optimizing energy use for various workplaces.

In Mainland China, meanwhile, the country’s ""dual carbon"" goals, peaking emissions by 2030 and achieving neutrality by 2060, are complemented by Hong Kong’s Climate Action Blueprint 2050. These government-led commitments translate into tangible demand for expertise in carbon accounting, emissions reduction strategies, and compliance reporting. With its memberships in top professional bodies in the environmental protection field, AEC Group is well-positioned to be a go-to partner for businesses navigating these regulations, especially as carbon markets mature in the Greater Bay Area and beyond.

The NPF trend exacts pressure for small and medium enterprises operating in the region to go green. Comprising majority of the region’s corporate demographics, given their budget constraints and discreet customization needs, SMEs tend to commission their NPF adaptation works to smaller service providers they can rely on. AEC Group stands a good chance to fill this market vacuum with affordable, practical solutions, such as energy-saving audits or sustainability reports tailored to smaller budgets, thereby unlocking a steady stream of clients eager to meet new standards without their means. The wins in Macau and the expansion into Malaysia in 2023 were good examples.

Yet the bigger peers such as AECOM and ARUP are also looking into capturing shares in this new NPF trend. AEC Group needs to highlight its niche in provision of highly customized services, such as advising on carbon credit trading or integrating smart technologies into building designs to create a distinct identity that sets it apart from the competition.

AEC Group also needs a deep dive into pushing boundaries in its consulting game plan. It needs to indulge in cutting-edge tools, such as using artificial intelligence to crunch environmental data for sharper insights, or blockchain to track carbon emissions with transparency, innovations that elevate its services from standard to standout.

Nonetheless, AEC Group’s modest profitability, having turned around just a bit for the year to March 2024, might limit its capacity to chase major projects or invest more reasonably in. Its growth might hinge on strategic alliances, such as partnering with technology firms to co-develop green solutions, or to secure funding to scale operations and compete for bigger contracts.

With its service offerings and industry connections, AEC Group could offer clear, actionable carbon footprint assessments and reduction plans, positioning itself as a key player in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area’s emerging carbon trading markets. As far as smart green buildings are concerned, AEC Group could integrate accessible technologies like Internet-of-things sensors for provision of energy management services to assist green transition of buildings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jqsz73/aec_group_needs_better_strategies_to_ride_on_new/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jqsz73/aec_group_needs_better_strategies_to_ride_on_new/

Due to this and other Trump policies that have alienated many of our allies, I’ve been concerned the US economy, and even the World economy, might go into a recession. Even if there is a recovery, perhaps the world won’t welcome us back with open arms after the way the Trump administration has talked to and about our European allies, as well as the tariffs, leaving the US economy weaker, isolated, and more vulnerable.

Many of our “exports” are services which is precisely why American companies like Apple and Microsoft have done so well. Manufacturing, even if brought back, might not benefit the US economy the way it did the in the past. You can’t roll the clock back. The logistics alone of actually building new manufacturing facilities in the US, training and hiring workers, this all takes YEARS, even decades. One of the markers of an advanced economy is that service jobs make up a larger share of the market than manufacturing jobs.

Setting aside any objective views of whether we think stocks currently should be either 1) poised for a recovery or 2) on the verge of further losses, I'd be curious to hear how others view where we are in the emotional cycle right now. For example, you might think we're worried or panic stricken or even that (overall), we're already in some stage of rebuilding.

I'll save my thoughts about it for now. However, for perspective, I'd say that the buildup to the [dot.com](http://dot.com) crash was the clearest example I've ever seen of ""Euphoric."" In fact, it clearly was off the charts into irrational exuberance.

Where are we right now?

* Hopeful
* Positive
* Confident
* Thrilled
* Euphoric (Top)
* Surprised (First Stage of Decline)

* Worried

* Defeated (Bottom)
