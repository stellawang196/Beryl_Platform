2025-04-02 16:46:58,CarParts.com (NASDAQ: PRTS) Special Situation,Leather-Moment1068,1,"**Summary**

[CarParts.com](http://CarParts.com) ($PRTS) recently announced that they are exploring a sale of the business to maximize value. Since the pop post-announcement, the stock has traded down >20% due to macro weakness and their Q4 earnings report. 

PRTS is an online after-market auto parts retailer focused on non-discretionary collision parts. While this is a commoditized industry, PRTS differentiates itself from competitors by owning its supply chain (most online retailers in this space are drop shippers), offering a broad selection of private label and branded SKUs (1.5MM SKUs), and focusing on collision parts (PRTS is the 2nd largest collision auto parts importer in the U.S.). 

**Asymmetric Opportunity**

*Transaction Announcement*

* The immediate upside is a definitive transaction being announced and completed. 
   * PRTS is a highly strategic asset for other industry players considering their owned supply chain (with additional capacity to support 50% incremental revenue growth), $600MM in revenue, 100MM annual website visitors, and 10MM annual customers. 
   * We understand this to be a competitive public process with multiple parties at the table, including strategics and financial sponsors.
   * Craig Hallum is the bank selling the company. Craig Hallum's research division upgraded the stock to a **buy rating with a $3 PT (currently trades at $1) the day the strategic alternatives announcement was made**.
   * Wilson Sonsini is the sell-side legal advisor who is widely respected in the field of M&A. 

*Business as Usual - No Transaction*

* While PRTS's core business is commoditized and subject to volatility in their major cost centers (parts COGS, FedEx shipping, Google CPC), management is doing the right things to improve potential earnings power at the business:
   * Bypassing Google CPC (costs 18% of revenue when orders go through paid Search) with the launch of their mobile app in August 2023. The app now does over 10% of e-commerce revenue. Their closest comp in Europe has an app that contributes 60% of revenue (launched their app 6 years ago). The app also creates customer loyalty and drives repeat purchases.
   * Bypassing FedEx LTL by focusing on B2B sales to fleets and repair shops. Working with Diligent, the last-mile delivery service, to deliver products with operations currently active in 2/5 distribution centers (methodically expanding to ensure best service for national accounts). B2B contribution margin is 3x higher than DTC.
   * De-risking from low-income consumers who are more subject to economic cyclicality by stocking luxury European parts and taking up prices.
   * Focus on high-margin, fee-based income with the launch of subscriptions and other partnerships (e.g. roadside assistance, warranty, financing) to monetize their customer base.
* PRTS market cap = $57MM, cash =$36MM, debt = $0. Current book value and our adjusted net liquidation value = $85MM and $44MM, respectively, resulting in substantial margin of safety.
   * We do expect some cash burn this year from a weaker consumer inhibiting revenue and tariffs increasing inventory purchase costs which may reduce book value and our net liquidation value.
   * We estimate the stock trades at 0.9x normalized EBITDA (2026E) and 2.3x normalized FCF excluding working capital effects (2026E).

2024-10-03 19:25:41,$WFLD Positive Developments / Resumption of Trading and Planned Spinoff of Tradewind Markets Inc.,TradeToday,1,"Dear fellow Wellfield Technologies investors,

I want to update you on important news that affects our investment in Wellfield Technologies.

**Resumption of Trading**

I'm pleased to report that the TSX Venture Exchange has approved the resumption of trading effective October 1, 2024. This is a positive signal and restores liquidity for us shareholders.

**Planned Spinoff of Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Wellfield is continuing its efforts to spin off its wholly-owned subsidiary Tradewind Markets Inc. This spinoff is a key step in the strategy announced on July 16.

**What does this mean for us?**

1. Wellfield expects the spinoff to increase company value by allowing the markets to value Tradewind independently.
2. After the spinoff, Wellfield will be able to focus on its core competencies in cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance.
3. Wellfield will hold Tradewind shares worth $20 million USD, opening up various strategic options.

**Support for Tradewind**

Tradewind is set to be established as an independent entity focused on revolutionizing the gold market. An independent management team and board will be set up, to be announced in a later press release.

**My Assessment**

I see great potential in these developments for Wellfield. The resumption of trading and strategic realignment through the Tradewind spinoff could positively impact the value of our shares. I'm particularly interested in the focus on the core crypto business and the opportunities arising from owning Tradewind shares.

From a technical analysis perspective, the stock price was recently frozen due to the trading halt. With the resumption of trading and this positive news, we could see a reevaluation.

**Conclusion**

In the short term, it remains exciting to watch how the market reacts to the resumption of trading and spinoff plans. Long-term, I see Wellfield well-positioned with its focus on innovative DeFi solutions and strategic positioning through the Tradewind spinoff.

I continue to plan for a long investment horizon and will closely monitor the implementation of the spinoff and the future strategy of both companies.

Let's hope these steps help Wellfield establish itself as a leading company in the DeFi space!

Best regards,

TradeToday

**PS: Trading resumed as planned on October 1, 2024. It will be interesting to see how the stock price develops in the coming days.**

**PPS: It is always a good sign when the Chief Executive Officer continues to buy shares in his company.**

**$WFLD Positive Entwicklungen / Wiederaufnahme des Handels und geplante Abspaltung von Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Liebe Mitinvestoren von Wellfield Technologies,

ich möchte euch über wichtige Neuigkeiten informieren, die unser Investment in Wellfield Technologies betreffen.

**Wiederaufnahme des Handels**

Erfreulicherweise hat die TSX Venture Exchange die Wiederaufnahme des Handels mit Wirkung zum 1. Oktober 2024 genehmigt. Dies ist ein positives Signal und stellt die Liquidität für uns Aktionäre wieder her.

**Geplante Abspaltung von Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Wellfield setzt seine Bemühungen um die Abspaltung seiner hundertprozentigen Tochtergesellschaft Tradewind Markets Inc. fort. Diese Abspaltung ist ein wichtiger Schritt in der am 16. Juli angekündigten Strategie.

**Was bedeutet das für uns?**

1. Wellfield erwartet, dass die Abspaltung den Unternehmenswert steigern wird, indem sie es den Märkten ermöglicht, Tradewind unabhängig zu bewerten.
2. Nach der Abspaltung wird sich Wellfield auf seine Kernkompetenzen im Bereich Kryptowährungen und dezentrale Finanzen konzentrieren können.
3. Wellfield wird Tradewind-Aktien im Wert von 20 Millionen US-Dollar halten, was verschiedene strategische Optionen eröffnet.

**Unterstützung für Tradewind**

Tradewind soll als unabhängige Einheit etabliert werden, die sich auf die Revolutionierung des Goldmarktes konzentriert. Ein unabhängiges Managementteam und ein Vorstand werden eingerichtet, was in einer späteren Pressemitteilung bekannt gegeben wird.

**Meine Einschätzung**

Ich sehe in diesen Entwicklungen großes Potenzial für Wellfield. Die Wiederaufnahme des Handels und die strategische Neuausrichtung durch die Abspaltung von Tradewind könnten den Wert unserer Aktien positiv beeinflussen. Besonders interessant finde ich die Fokussierung auf das Kerngeschäft im Krypto-Bereich und die Möglichkeiten, die sich durch den Besitz der Tradewind-Aktien ergeben.

Charttechnisch war der Kurs zuletzt durch den Handelsstopp eingefroren. Mit der Wiederaufnahme des Handels und diesen positiven Nachrichten könnte es zu einer Neubewertung kommen.

**Fazit**

Kurzfristig bleibt die Entwicklung spannend zu beobachten, insbesondere wie der Markt auf die Wiederaufnahme des Handels und die Abspaltungspläne reagiert. Langfristig sehe ich Wellfield mit seinem Fokus auf innovative DeFi-Lösungen und der strategischen Positionierung durch die Tradewind-Abspaltung gut aufgestellt.

Ich plane weiterhin einen langen Anlagehorizont und werde die Umsetzung der Abspaltung sowie die zukünftige Strategie beider Unternehmen genau verfolgen.

Lasst uns hoffen, dass diese Schritte Wellfield dabei helfen, sich als führendes Unternehmen im DeFi-Bereich zu etablieren!

Viele Grüße

**PS: Der Handel wurde wie geplant am 1. Oktober 2024 wieder aufgenommen. Es wird interessant sein zu beobachten, wie sich der Kurs in den kommenden Tagen entwickelt.**

**PPS: Es ist immer ein gutes Zeichen, wenn der Vorstandsvorsitzende weiterhin Aktien seines Unternehmens kauft.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrocapStocks/comments/1fvfyd4/wfld_positive_developments_resumption_of_trading/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrocapStocks/comments/1fvfyd4/wfld_positive_developments_resumption_of_trading/
2024-09-06 15:37:54,$WFLD Good News / Reverse Take-Over (RTO) of Tradewind Markets Inc.,TradeToday,3,"Dear Wellfield Technologies Investors,

I want to inform you about a significant development that could greatly impact our investment in Wellfield Technologies.

**Reverse Take-Over (RTO) of Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Wellfield Technologies has entered into a definitive agreement with Leonovus Inc., which will lead to a Reverse Take-Over (RTO). Leonovus will acquire all issued and outstanding common shares of Tradewind Markets Inc., a subsidiary of Wellfield. Upon completion of the RTO, Leonovus will be renamed “Tradewind Markets Inc.”

**What does this mean for us?**

Tradewind Markets is revolutionizing the digital gold market through the use of blockchain technology. With products like VaultChain™ Gold and VaultChain™ Silver, Tradewind has already digitized physical metal worth over 170 million CAD. The introduction of smart contract-based DeFi services, including an Automated Market-Maker (AMM) for spot gold trading, is on the horizon.

**Support from Wellfield**

Wellfield will continue to support Tradewind, especially in the first 18 months following the RTO. This collaboration aims to ensure that Tradewind can further develop its innovative platform and expand its market leadership in digital gold trading.

**Financing and Shareholder Approval**

A private placement equity financing is planned to raise a minimum of 4 million CAD and a maximum of 6 million CAD. Several transactions and changes require the approval of Leonovus shareholders, including the name change, share consolidation, and approval of the RTO.

**My Assessment**

I see enormous potential in this development for Wellfield. The innovative technology of Tradewind and the support from Wellfield could significantly increase the value of our shares. Of course, the investment remains speculative, but the long-term prospects are promising.

I have used the price drops to buy more shares and lower my average purchase price. From a technical analysis perspective, the price has been in a sideways range for almost a month. These news could lead to a breakout from the range and potentially rising prices.

**Conclusion**

In the short term, the stock price remains a test of patience. However, in the long term, I am convinced that Wellfield, with its groundbreaking DeFi solutions and the support of Tradewind, can be successful. I am planning a very long investment horizon and will closely monitor the developments.

Let’s hope together that Wellfield, with its innovative solutions, becomes one of the leading DeFi companies of the future!

Best regards,

TradeToday

**PS: A trading halt was in effect at the time of this posting!**

 (The trading halt on Wellfield Technologies was imposed by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO). Such trading halts are often implemented to ensure a fair and orderly market, especially when significant corporate news is released. In this case, the trading halt is likely - I'm almost certain - related to the announcement of the reverse take-over (RTO) by Tradewind Markets Inc. to ensure that all market participants have a chance to process the new information. It will be interesting to see what happens when this is lifted).

**$WFLD Gute Nachrichten / Reverse Take-Over (RTO) von Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Liebe Mitinvestoren von Wellfield Technologies,

ich möchte euch über eine bedeutende Entwicklung informieren, die unser Investment in Wellfield Technologies maßgeblich beeinflussen könnte.

**Reverse Take-Over (RTO) von Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Wellfield Technologies hat eine endgültige Vereinbarung mit Leonovus Inc. getroffen, die zu einem Reverse Take-Over (RTO) führen wird. Leonovus wird alle ausgegebenen und ausstehenden Stammaktien von Tradewind Markets Inc., einer Tochtergesellschaft von Wellfield, übernehmen. Nach Abschluss des RTO wird Leonovus in “Tradewind Markets Inc.” umbenannt.

**Was bedeutet das für uns?**

Tradewind Markets revolutioniert den digitalen Goldmarkt durch die Nutzung von Blockchain-Technologie. Mit Produkten wie VaultChain™ Gold und VaultChain™ Silver hat Tradewind bereits physisches Metall im Wert von über 170 Millionen CAD digitalisiert. Die Einführung von Smart-Contract-basierten DeFi-Dienstleistungen, einschließlich eines Automated Market-Makers (AMM) für den Spot-Goldhandel, steht bevor.

**Unterstützung durch Wellfield**

Wellfield wird Tradewind weiterhin unterstützen, insbesondere in den ersten 18 Monaten nach dem RTO. Diese Zusammenarbeit soll sicherstellen, dass Tradewind seine innovative Plattform weiterentwickeln und seine Marktführerschaft im digitalen Goldhandel ausbauen kann.

**Finanzierung und Aktionärszustimmung**

Es ist eine Privatplatzierungs-Eigenkapitalfinanzierung geplant, um mindestens 4 Millionen CAD und maximal 6 Millionen CAD zu beschaffen. Mehrere Transaktionen und Änderungen bedürfen der Zustimmung der Leonovus-Aktionäre, darunter die Namensänderung, die Aktienkonsolidierung und die Genehmigung der RTO.

**Meine Einschätzung**

Ich sehe in dieser Entwicklung ein enormes Potenzial für Wellfield. Die innovative Technologie von Tradewind und die Unterstützung durch Wellfield könnten den Wert unserer Aktien erheblich steigern. Natürlich bleibt das Investment spekulativ, aber die langfristigen Chancen sind vielversprechend.

Ich habe die Kursverluste genutzt, um nachzukaufen und meinen Durchschnittskaufpreis zu senken. Charttechnisch befindet sich der Kurs schon seit fast einem Monat in einer Seitwärtsrange. Diese Neuigkeiten könnten dazu führen, dass wir zeitnah wieder aus der Range nach oben ausbrechen und sodann wieder steigende Kurse sehen.

**Fazit**

Kurzfristig bleibt der Kurs eine Geduldsprobe. Doch längerfristig bin ich überzeugt, dass Wellfield mit seinen bahnbrechenden DeFi-Lösungen und der Unterstützung von Tradewind erfolgreich sein kann. Ich plane einen sehr langen Anlagehorizont ein und werde die Entwicklungen genau verfolgen.

Lasst uns gemeinsam hoffen, dass Wellfield mit innovativen Lösungen zu einem der führenden DeFi-Unternehmen der Zukunft wird!

Viele Grüße

 **PS: Zum Zeitpunkt dieses Post, wurde ein Handelsstopp verhängt!**

(Der Handelsstopp bei Wellfield Technologies wurde von der Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) verhängt. Solche Handelsstopps werden oft implementiert, um einen fairen und geordneten Markt zu gewährleisten, insbesondere wenn bedeutende Unternehmensnachrichten veröffentlicht werden. In diesem Fall hängt der Handelsstopp wahrscheinlich - ich bin mir fast sicher - mit der Ankündigung des Reverse Take-Over (RTO) von Tradewind Markets Inc. zusammen, um sicherzustellen, dass alle Marktteilnehmer die Möglichkeit haben, die neuen Informationen zu verarbeiten. Es wird spannend, was passiert, wenn dieser wieder aufgehoben wird.)

Hello Wellfield Investors and Stakeholders,

As we navigate through an exciting and transitional period of growth and innovation at Wellfield, I want to address several pertinent topics regarding our current projects, future endeavors, and highlight recent press releases that provide further context to ongoing operations at Wellfield. I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge the questions and feedback we have received from you. Your insights are crucial to our strategy and operations, and in this update, I will address the key themes that resonate most strongly with you: our share price performance, Coinmama growth, our Gold product offerings, and other future strategic plans. 

Share Price Performance

We understand that recent fluctuations in the stock have been concerning, especially when they do not seem to align with the performance of related assets like Bitcoin. We remain committed to our strategic goals and are optimistic about the future of our company. We are actively working on a few initiatives we have recently announced, including the launch of our Gold products, and enhancing Coinmama's offerings with mobile app integrating Fireblocks technology. Each of these initiatives represents a significant opportunity for our company to grow and deliver value to our shareholders.

We acknowledge that building market awareness and attracting new investors is an area where we can improve. To this end, we are focused on leveraging our most innovative solutions, such Gold trading platform for institutional clients, and wGLD- gold for retail clients on Ethereum blockchain with Optimism products, for new awareness efforts which we believe will capture
attention and differentiate WFLD in the marketplace in 2024.

While we cannot predict future stock price movements, we are confident in our business model, our team, and our strategy. We believe that by executing on our plans and continuing to innovate, we can create long-term value for all our stakeholders. Our management team is not only attentive but also personally invested in the prosperity of our share value. We are implementing robust strategies aimed at improving our financial health and market position, thereby enhancing shareholder value. Coinmama Growth Growing our user base on Coinmama and deepening engagement continue to be a cornerstone of our success. Our focus remains on enhancing user experience and increasing our service offerings to attract and retain users. Shifting the focus to Mobile
Coinmama stands as one of the world's most enduring and trusted brands, offering customers a seamless way to transition their funds onto the blockchain while retaining complete control over their cryptocurrency. As more and more of Coinmama's clients opt for mobile access, Wellfield has taken steps to future-proof the Coinmama mobile app through its partnership with Fireblocks. This collaboration integrates Fireblocks' non-custodial wallet-as-a-service solutions
into the core of the Coinmama wallet. With this enhancement, customers can maintain full control over the cryptocurrency they purchase from Coinmama, enjoying simple and secure access to the best of Web3 and DeFi, all from a single platform. Other benefits of the new Coinmama mobile app will be disclosed and available when we launch towards mid-year.
Wellfield’s Gold Product Offerings
The recent launch of wGLD is an exciting development that we believe will significantly enhance our product offerings. This initiative will allow our users to invest in gold with the added benefit of earning yield, merging traditional asset security with innovative financial technology. That said, we remain committed to servicing two distinct blockchain-based gold ecosystems, each catering to specific investor communities: 

VaultChain Gold and wGLD.

• VaultChain Gold: 

Developed on the Tradewind Ledger, VaultChain Gold offers a closed precious metals trading platform tailored exclusively to Custodial Participants of the Royal Canadian Mint and their clients. This initiative revolutionizes the institutional gold marketplace, providing unparalleled accessibility, security, and efficiency in precious metals trading.

• wGLD: 

Serving as the cornerstone of a global and open gold ecosystem for the DeFi
community on Ethereum, wGLD embodies Wellfield's commitment to democratizing
access to physical gold. With its launch on Optimism, a prominent Ethereum Layer 2
blockchain, wGLD opens new horizons for DeFi enthusiasts, enabling seamless
integration into decentralized trading, lending, borrowing, and yield-generation
opportunities. For more information about wGLD, visit https://www.wellfield.gold.

Strategic Path Forward

Our roadmap is designed to foster sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value. Key focuses include scaling our core business operations, advancing our DeFi strategy and patent applications, diversifying our revenue streams, and continuing to innovate within the crypto and financial technology sectors. We are also prioritizing the integration of recent partnerships and
acquisitions to streamline operations and leverage synergies within the space as well as enhancing shareholder value.
In closing, I want you to know that your feedback drives our decisions and long-term planning. As we move forward, your continued support and feedback remain invaluable to us. We are committed to transparency and are excited to share these updates with you as they develop.
Thank you for your ongoing support and belief in our vision.

Hallo Wellfield-Investoren und -Stakeholder,

wir befinden uns in einer aufregenden Übergangsphase des Wachstums und der Innovation bei Wellfield. Ich möchte einige relevante Themen ansprechen, die unsere aktuellen Projekte und zukünftigen Bestrebungen betreffen, und die jüngsten Pressemitteilungen hervorheben, die
weitere Informationen zu den laufenden Aktivitäten bei Wellfield liefern. Ich möchte mich auch für die Fragen und Rückmeldungen bedanken, die wir von Ihnen erhalten haben. Ihre Erkenntnisse sind für unsere Strategie und unsere Geschäftstätigkeit von entscheidender
Bedeutung, und in diesem Update werde ich auf die Kernthemen eingehen, die Ihnen am
meisten am Herzen liegen: unsere Aktienkursentwicklung, das Wachstum von Coinmama, unser Goldprodukt-Angebot und andere zukünftige strategische Pläne.

Aktienkursentwicklung

Wir verstehen, dass die jüngsten Schwankungen der Aktie besorgniserregend waren, vor allem, wenn sie nicht mit der Performance von verwandten Vermögenswerten wie Bitcoin übereinstimmen. Wir halten an unseren strategischen Zielen fest und sind optimistisch, was die Zukunft unseres Unternehmens angeht. Wir arbeiten aktiv an einigen Initiativen, die wir kürzlich angekündigt haben, darunter die Einführung unserer Goldprodukte und die Erweiterung des Angebots von Coinmama durch eine mobile App, die die Fireblocks-Technologie integriert. Jede dieser Initiativen stellt eine bedeutende Chance für unser Unternehmen dar, zu wachsen und unseren Aktionären einen Mehrwert zu bieten.
Wir sind uns bewusst, dass die Steigerung des Marktbewusstseins und die Gewinnung neuer Anleger ein Bereich ist, in dem wir uns verbessern können. Zu diesem Zweck konzentrieren wir uns darauf, unsere innovativsten Lösungen, wie die Goldhandelsplattform für institutionelle
Kunden und wGLD-Gold für Privatkunden auf der Ethereum-Blockchain mit Optimismus-
Produkten, für neue Sensibilisierungsmaßnahmen zu nutzen, von denen wir glauben, dass sie die Aufmerksamkeit auf sich ziehen und WFLD im Jahr 2024 auf dem Markt differenzieren
werden.

Auch wenn wir die zukünftige Entwicklung des Aktienkurses nicht vorhersagen können, sind wir von unserem Geschäftsmodell, unserem Team und unserer Strategie überzeugt. Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass wir durch die Umsetzung unserer Pläne und durch kontinuierliche Innovation langfristige Werte für alle unsere Interessengruppen schaffen können. Unser Managementteam ist nicht nur aufmerksam, sondern auch persönlich in das Wachstum unseres Aktienwerts investiert.
Wir verfolgen die Umsetzung solider Strategien zur Verbesserung unserer finanziellen Stabilität und Marktposition und damit zur Steigerung des Unternehmenswertes.

Coinmama Wachstum
Die Vergrößerung unserer Nutzerbasis auf Coinmama und die Verstärkung des Engagements sind weiterhin ein Eckpfeiler unseres Erfolgs. Unser Fokus liegt weiterhin auf der Verbesserung der Nutzererfahrung und der Erweiterung unseres Serviceangebots, um Nutzer anzuziehen und
zu binden. Verlagerung des Schwerpunkts auf Mobile Coinmama ist eine der beständigsten und vertrauenswürdigsten Marken der Welt und bietet
Kunden eine nahtlose Möglichkeit, ihre Gelder auf die Blockchain zu übertragen und dabei die vollständige Kontrolle über ihre Kryptowährung zu behalten. Da sich immer mehr Kunden von Coinmama für einen mobilen Zugang interessieren, hat Wellfield Schritte unternommen, um die mobile App von Coinmama durch seine Partnerschaft mit Fireblocks zukunftssicher zu machen.
Diese Zusammenarbeit integriert die nicht-pfändbaren Wallet-as-a-Service-Lösungen von Fireblocks in den Kern der Coinmama-Wallet. Mit dieser Erweiterung können Kunden die volle Kontrolle über die Kryptowährung behalten, die sie bei Coinmama kaufen und genießen einen
einfachen und sicheren Zugriff auf das Beste von Web3 und DeFi, alles von einer einzigen
Plattform aus. Weitere Vorteile der neuen Coinmama Mobile App werden bekannt gegeben und verfügbar sein, wenn wir gegen Mitte des Jahres starten.

Wellfields Gold-Produktangebote

Die kürzliche Einführung von wGLD ist eine aufregende Entwicklung, von der wir glauben, dass sie unser Produktangebot erheblich erweitern wird. Diese Initiative wird es unseren Nutzern ermöglichen, in Gold zu investieren und gleichzeitig eine Rendite zu erwirtschaften, indem sie die Sicherheit traditioneller Vermögenswerte mit innovativer Finanztechnologie verbindet.
Nichtsdestotrotz werden wir auch weiterhin zwei verschiedene Blockchain-basierte Gold-Ökosysteme anbieten, die sich jeweils an bestimmte Anlegergruppen richten: 

VaultChain Gold und wGLD.

• VaultChain Gold: 

VaultChain Gold wurde auf der Grundlage des Tradewind Ledger entwickelt und bietet eine geschlossene Edelmetallhandelsplattform, die ausschließlich auf die Custodial Participants der Royal Canadian Mint und deren Kunden

2024-04-29 11:30:27,DeFi Disruptor Wellfield Tech Going Layer 2 - Loading Up For Moon Mission?,TradeToday,2,"Fellow Ape Degenerates,

Your degen options trader TradeToday here with a juicy update on Wellfield Technologies Inc. ($WFLD) that you won't want to miss. Full disclosure, I posted a similar thesis on another investing platform last few weeks ago.

First off, let's address the elephant in the room - Wellfield has been an absolute beatdown lately, plunging to 6 cents CAD. As a grizzled vet in these Pampas, I know all too well the risks of penny stock investing. But I also know bigger risks mean bigger potential rewards for us degen apes willing to go full send.

Despite the carnage, I'm still fully convinced of Wellfield's massive potential in the DeFi space. Their visionary plans, stacked patent filings, and partnerships with players like Banxa and Fireblocks point to some serious moonshot opportunities.

The real game-changer here is Wellfield's latest move to the Optimism Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. This bad boy uses cutting-edge rollup tech to bundle tons of transactions on L2, then settle them on the Ethereum mainnet for peanuts in gas fees.

**But here's the kicker** - Optimism is fully compatible and secure with Ethereum, so Wellfield can build out their whole decentralized fintech ecosystem on it with insane scalability. We're talking decentralized trading for crypto, stocks, ETFs and more all powered by these low gas L2 vibes.

Where I see the real tendies is in their planned rollout of these products onto the Coinmama platform with its huge existing user base. Suddenly Wellfield can start juicing revenue and profits from all that user activity and volume with monetization from:

* Transaction fees
* Building a decentralized order book
* And more

The Situation:

* Averaged down, currently at $0.24 CAD cost basis
* $0.05 CAD bottom could mark turnaround if buying overtakes selling
* Watching for triangle breakout, under 5 cents would be warning sign

Gotta give props to Wellfield's execution so far:

✅ Website revamp

✅ User marketing

✅ Coinmama trading platform live

Combine that with these new scalable products and we could see a major rev/profit ramp. Those $5M CAD raises are key growth investments.

What really gives me conviction though is management's consistent delivery on their announcements. The gold-backed wGLD token hit mainnet in Q1 as forecast, the Coinmama and Tradewind acquisitions closed on schedule, and the global Coinmama app rollout to 180+ countries is coming this summer.

**TLDR:** Make no mistake, this is a white-knuckle, high-risk play in the near-term. But long-term, I'm betting big that Wellfield can leverage Optimism's scalability and their multi-product suite to emerge as a disruptive DeFi heavyweight - IF they nail the rollout. As an investor who's felt the burn before, I'm strapped in for an extended trip to alpha centauri on this one.

Will be watching their progress and milestones like a hawk while constantly reevaluating my position. Can't rule out a total loss either. But let's hope Wellfield takes the DeFi universe by storm with these game-changing solutions!

Unlike most OTC companies
Powerdyne actually accrues revenue and profits of substantial amount.
Their business is generated from a 2022 acquisition of creative motion technology. Which included CM tech, a motor production company. These motors serve factory automation robots.(Al)

Along with the acquisition of CM tech was ""Frame One"". A custom framing shop. Frame One has been in business Since 2006 and brings with it a strong client base of local schools, colleges, artists, interior decorators/designers, museums, photographers, art galleries and theaters. This may seem quite simple but it generates revenue and thats more than what 99% of otc ceos can do.

The company's ceo has previously acknowledged Al. The CM tech company producing motors supplies semiconductor companies with these motor where they are creating chips for the purpose of Al.
With the ongoing emergence and growth 
“With the ongoing emergence and growth of artificial intelligence (Al) we are anticipating and preparing for an increase in demand for
CM Tech's custom designed motors. Currently,
CM Tech does not directly supply the Al market but supplies the motors to the semiconductor equipment manufacturers who produce and service the automated equipment that is responsible for making the silicon wafers used in the micro processing chips. These microchips are used in Al as well as in smart TVs, cell phones, computers, and virtually every smart device produced today.”

Next expected update will be the annual report which is expect to boast 1.4 million revenue.

2021-09-26 23:22:28,LexaGene $LXG.V ($LXXGF)- An interesting play in the diagnostics space.,Guy_LeBlanc,1,"LexaGene’s MiQlab is an automated PCR device that can test for 27 targets at the same time and provide results within 2 hours.

Automated means no more need for highly skilled employees to perform these tests, reducing time, money and chance of errors.

PCR is the gold standard.  It provides accurate results and can provide quantitative information.

The ability to simultaneously test 27 targets means we’re not just ruling out a diagnosis, but we can end up with a very good probability of ruling in a diagnosis and having a much better idea which treatments should be used.

Results in 2 hours means we no longer have to wait for labs to provide the results which can take from 24 hours to 28 days depending on what is being tested.  Regardless of what the target is, the MiQLab completes it in within 2 hours.

There are other PCR devices out there, so what is special about the MiQLab? 

OPEN ACCESS is the feature an investor really needs to understand.

This makes the MiQLab the first of its kind with no direct comparator.

Open access allows customers with different patient populations to customize by looking for the 27 targets they are more likely to see in their practice.  This greatly increases the chance of an accurate diagnosis rather than just ruling out certain things.  No more guessing!

LexaGene also focuses on antimicrobial resistance (AMR).  The MiQLab can predict if a certain pathogen will be resistant to certain antibiotics.

Many scientists believe AMR could be the cause of the next pandemic.

CEO Jack Regan is the inventor of the MiQLab and founder of LexaGene.  He owns a big chunk of shares and is fully committed to making this work.  This isn’t his first rodeo with this type of device.

COO Steve Armstrong has been responsible for obtaining FDA and global regulatory approvals in over 100 countries for more than 50 devices with hundreds of indications, implementing best-in-class quality management systems, and ensuring worldwide compliance.

Many industries require timely, accurate pathogen testing before they can serve their customers, and LexaGene will be targeting all of these.

Vet, Food, Human, Biologic + Cannabis + Vaccine producers , Research, Agriculture, Cosmetics, Water safety, US Army etc...

LexaGene is debt free and has enough cash for several months while they concentrate on marketing, FDA submission and increasing sales.

The MiQLab is very affordable compared to other devices on the market.

Their razor blade model uses simple disposable cartridges, not expensive custom embedded cartridges like the competition.

LexaGene is actively preparing for FDA submission and uplisting to Nasdaq, so that they will have things in place when the time is right.

What are the main challenges?

1.  Share price is down since the company became public.
2.  The company is growing and they might need to raise more money next year.
3.  FDA approval is never guaranteed.
4.  Adoption by clinics and hospitals could end up being challenging.

Despite these challenges I still think LexaGene is a risk worth taking.  Worse case, I don’t think they go to zero and they get bought out.  Best case, they become one of the leaders and the stock goes up 100X in the next 5 to 10 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrocapStocks/comments/pw4s35/lexagene_lxgv_lxxgf_an_interesting_play_in_the/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrocapStocks/comments/pw4s35/lexagene_lxgv_lxxgf_an_interesting_play_in_the/

2021-08-28 00:50:58,This small holding company is up almost 10% in the past week! Here's why,Friendly-Ad-2958,1,"This company is MBHCF - a holding company which began in 2016 that is actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses.

MBH has announced on 19 August 2021 that it agreed to the terms for the acquisition of Vista Care Solutions Limited (Vista Care) as the latest step in its extensive acquisition drive. The completion of this acquisition is subject to regulatory approval for the proposed change of ownership from UK city councils. Upon receiving approval, Vista Care will become part of MBH's health vertical, joining Samuel Hobson House.

MBH added four new industry verticals alone in 2020 as part of a concerted acquisition drive which is continuing in 2021 with Vista care becoming the 26th company in the Group portfolio.

This has likely proven to be a catalyst, driving the share price up by almost 10% in the past week.

Analysts have price targets at up to $10 for this stock, which currently trades at about $0.30 a share. Personally, I’d seriously weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. There are some bullish signs in the company’s financials, yet there are also certain metrics that raise eyebrows, like the dilution of shares and low volume. It’s hard to say whether the company will be back in full swing after the end of the pandemic.

2021-08-05 14:34:59,Small acquisition companies: Possible 3000% upside?,Friendly-Ad-2958,1,"  

Berkshire Hathaway has dominated the market for holding companies for a long time. However, over the years, smaller and more exciting holding companies have emerged with refreshing new approaches. These small holding companies could seriously become something huge in the future. One play I'm looking at is MBHCF, a holding company which began in 2018 that is actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. 

**PROS:**

***Strong financials***

The company has a strong and competitive P/e ratio of 8 (TTM), revenue growth of 19% (from 2019A to 2020A) and gross margin of 20.9% (from 2019A to 2020A). P/b ratio is also healthy at about 0.3. They have produced surprisingly promising numbers despite the hit taken from Covid-19. 

***Dividends***

The company ended the year in profit despite being heavily disrupted by the Covid-19 virus. The dividend is paid out at $0.0059 per share, which is about 2% of the current share price.

***Diversification***

The company has completed a total of 26 acquisitions so far, with 12 acquisitions in 2020 alone. The rate at which MBH is acquiring companies is impressive, and the acquired companies have very high profitability.

***Small market cap***

With a market cap of just over 20M USD, there is huge growth potential for this company as it continues with its expansion model. Small cap stocks have historically produced greater annual returns than mid-cap and large-cap stocks due to greater growth potential and better returns in the long term.

***Bullish estimates***

Analysts suggest that it could have a price target of $10 based on its financials and projected estimates, resulting in an upside of over 3000%.

Here’s a link to the analyst report:

[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/MBHCF/news/BUY-RATING-FOR-MBH-CORPORATION-PLC-AT-10-PRICE-TARGET?id=302215](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/MBHCF/news/BUY-RATING-FOR-MBH-CORPORATION-PLC-AT-10-PRICE-TARGET?id=302215)

However, there are still things to consider when looking into such a stock. Here are some things to consider.

**RISKS:**

***Dilution of shares***

The total number of shares outstanding amounted to 70.5M at the end of 2020, up from 39.2M at the end of 2019. Dilution of shares is always a concern as it lowers the EPS. However, it is important to note that the extra shares were issued as payment to acquire companies, so this could very well be a strategic move if these acquisitions generate sufficient profit for MBH. Future profits could also be used to buy back shares to improve EPS.

***Uncertainty about post-Covid situation***

We all know how disruptive the Covid-19 situation is, especially to small businesses. It’s not certain if all companies are able to bounce back and operate at their full potential. As such, being an acquisition company, MBH is open to the risk of underperforming if their acquired companies face difficulty in recovering from the situation.

In conclusion, micro-caps are often risky. Whether you enter a position in this stock or not depends on how much you believe in the expansion model and future profitability of MBH. Personally, I believe it's a risk worth taking because of its prospects and financials. Going long term on this seems to be a decent play.

***Selected by three leading North American operators to deploy and improve 5G connectivity in dense urban & in rural areas***

LITTLE FALLS, N.J., June 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- [Ceragon Networks Ltd.](https://www.ceragon.com/)   (NASDAQ: CRNT), the global innovator and leading solutions provider of   5G wireless transport, has announced new orders and renewed  partnerships  with large North American service providers. These orders  focus on  expanding 5G network reach in dense areas, as well as keeping  rural  areas connected, up to speed, and able to compete with the rest  of the  world on a level footing. These material orders, among others,  have  resulted in strong Q2 bookings in North America.

One   of the companies who selected Ceragon is a large Tier 1 North American   carrier who field-tested multiple solutions. As Ceragon performed  better  than competitors, the operator successfully deployed, validated,  and  accepted Ceragon's Multiband Solution delivering a staggering 10  Gbps  over 4 miles. Thanks to this solution, mobile subscribers will see   higher download speeds and the operator will enjoy increased customer   satisfaction and reduced churn.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrocapStocks/comments/oaz0sj/crnt_has_a_north_american_tier_1_as_well_as_3/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrocapStocks/comments/oaz0sj/crnt_has_a_north_american_tier_1_as_well_as_3/

In    a nutshell, the 5G rollout began 1 year ago… 1st  phase of rollout is    to the large population centers where access to  fiber and massive    amounts of customer cash is all around. OVERLOOKED is  the SECOUND phase    of the rollout;  which is connecting the REST OF THE URBAN AND RURAL    area (where fiber  is unavailable, too expensive to be laid) between  the   population centers  with wireless nodes….. necessitating the    replacement/upgrade of tens of  millions of cellular radios/receivers,    nodes,  etc.  MASSIVE equipment upgrades are needed to support 5G    wireless mid  and back hauling. The small cap firms that support this    phase of the  rollout have been simply over looked, especially the ones    that provide  “Best of Breed” components that are swiftly becoming  a    necessity for 5g. The second phase of the rollout will go on for     YEARS. 

In the past the telecom    large caps  like Nokia, Ericson and Huawei bundled front/mid/back haul    equipment in  with other services and components to create bundled    packages to sell to  the Tier 1 carriers, shutting out the smaller    companies.   Not this time.  5G requires OpenRAN , Best of Breed parts    for the  networks to minimize latency while exponentially increasing    speed and  bandwidth.  Tier 1 Carriers are going Best of Breed for    component’s  using an OpenRAN standard.  This removes the threat  of    bundled deals from a large section of the equation. This will  directly    benefit the small/micro caps w the best of breed components.  CRNT is    one of these small caps… my opinion is that it will move; and  move  big.

Ceragon   (CRNT) basically  split the Best of Breed market with Huawei..  which  is  now mostly  banned from participating in most western &  Indian   networks …  this removes CRNT’s main competition for best of breed    wireless  front/mid/back haul radios in most markets.   Connecting the   rural  areas for 5g is just starting.. CRNT has 12+  announced 5G design   wins  all over the world.  There is speculation that  they landed a  large   DISH contract for a greenfield (new) 5g network in  North  America.    (see Cowen Investment Call [https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen90/crnt/1966227](https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen90/crnt/1966227)at  5:15ish . )  Also, from Cowen conf call .... Dish did NOT invite    Ericson nor Nokia to participate in the contract bidding as they were     only getting bids from best of breed components. CRNT is also releasing     a next generation 5G chipset capable of 100Gb wireless…tapeout  slated    for JULY 2021….  The author, and CRNT management (as stated in  conf    calls) knows of no other advanced 5G wireless  chipset in  development   that comes close to these speeds. This should be  a MAJOR  additional   advantage.

Trading w a  market cap   of about $307 Million .. a massively discounted  1.1 times  anticipated   2021 sales, conservative management, 12+ 5G wins, A  NEW  100Gb wireless   chipset taping out within 60 days (stated in July on   last conf  call),   the very real potential  to double or triple rev  from this  chipset, as  well as the potential to  OEM it to current  competitors, or  spin the  chip division off as a new  company, or just  get completely  bought out.  CRNT, with Neptune (their  100Gb wireless  5G chipset) has  vast potential   that wallstreet has completely  overlooked.

All   research has  been gleaned from  public information, web research,   intuition and  conference calls. Not  investment advice, simply pointing   out a  company that I believe is a  diamond in the rough; as such the   author  is LONG on CRNT and has  been accumulating for over a year.

CO2 Gro dissolves CO2 into the water which is then applied to plants to increase their growth and yield while protecting against pathogens. The company has numerous trials underway with some very significant growers. The goal for CO2 Gro is to reach cash-flow positive in 2021. I believe this is definitely in reach as a major grower completes their trial at the end of June 2021.

This grower, Hidroexpo, has already stated that they achieved a 20% increase in bell pepper yield and is happy with the trial results.

Hidroexpo is just one of many trials underway including numerous trials (and some small sales) to cannabis growers who can recoup their investment in as little as 1 grow.

2021-05-20 12:45:32,Note the reversal in MBH Corp.,SerjKu,2," Stumbled across articles on Reddit not too long ago about this company in penny stocks blocks. I see that the company has recently entered the OTC market and is not covered by analysts on the serious Internet, so I decided to address them here.  
Having investigated at my leisure, I concluded that the company is sold at a significant discount. As you know the ‘market trades future events as the current ones are already priced in. So, Europe and the UK are already coming out of the crisis, the proportion of the vaccinated population is rising, and with it, businesses are opening, and economic activity is increasing.  


The analysts covering this company, most likely a commissioned study, suggest a target price of $10. Let's face it, anything can happen but on what planning horizon. | don't really trust sell-side analysts, so I form my own estimate, luckily with experience.  


On my part, I assume that the company should return to March 2020 values, i.e. $1, within a year and a half. In my view, this is the most conservative forecast expected for this stock, as the company has done about 15 mergers over 3 period of more than a year, expanding its portfolio. Retail and construction are also recovering, which is 70% of the holding’s revenues. On top of that, the company has not realized any negative effects of quarantine at the management level, etc. Bond payments are on track and the holding structure is only growing, with no disposal of subsidiaries.

2021-04-28 00:38:34,RIWI: Grew revenue 47% last year and aiming for $30 million in revenue by 2024,BattleshipBG,4,"RIWI (RIWI.V) posted their 2020 results not long ago. They grew revenue 47% in 2020 and signed numerous partnership deals with large data providers like Amazon Web Services and Bloomberg. RIWI's technology has been proven numerous times. They can collect data that many other alternative data providers simply cannot.

The share price has declined to its lowest point since early 2019 even though they have $4 million in cash on the balance sheet and no debt.

The company is facing some uncertainty as the founder/CEO is stepping away from the CEO role and becoming Chairman of the board. This uncertainty has increased risk but I feel this is reflected in the stock price.

**I own shares of RIWI.V and may add around the $1.50 to $2 price.**

I wrote up my thought on RIWI's 2020 results:

Scott said during the Maxim Conference. His goal is to turn this company into a multi billion dollar company. We won't get there overnight. They have more data about the core of their science now and I am sure they are working hard to expand the pipeline while they move the NPC trials forward.

TLDR: $RVP received a similar contract in July and it shot up $6.00 in less than two weeks then skyrocketed to where it’s at currently where it’s bounced off EMA and is going up. Due to the need for syringes I think it will do the same in the next few weeks especially because calls expire on the 19th of March and on the 29th is quarterly earnings. 


Retractable Technologies designs develops manufactures in market safety syringes and other medical products for the healthcare industry and United States the rest of North and South America and internationally it principally offers vanish point safety products comprising  tuberculin, insulin, auto disable, allergy antigen, syringes IV catheters blood collection two holders blood collection sets in patient safety medical products including syringes in luer caps the company also engages in developing retractable needles, syringe,Glass syringes,dental syringes, is IV catheters, blood collection sets and easy point needles. retractable technologies Inc. also serves as healthcare providers such as acute hospital care alternative care facilities doctors office clinics emergency center surgical centers long-term facilities Veteran centers serves military organizations and prisons.

Their filing with the SEC on the 12th also says the contract with HHS is from feb to July @ 54,000,000 so about 10m a month and then a possible renewing of the contract for seven one month options if it goes well.

I personally think this is an easy hold to July that’s when the contract ends and when I feel most people will have their second vaccination done. Then we might see a drop of the stock. At the moment though this seems like and easy ride for some gains since earnings is in March.

2021-01-29 01:03:44,$KABN - Serious potential growth (Digital Identity and Online Verification),SpicyInvestor,3,"Refining my post quality after two previous failures, I have been reading reddit for 6 months and have now decided to share my voice to a community that has helped me so much. Also after creating this post I realized that I have not the karma to post on r/pennystocks so I will post it here instead.

**Disclosure:** I have been holding KABN systems North America for almost 1 month now. For disclosure I got in at and average of 25.6 cents the stock price climbed to 37 cents and currently sits at 22 cents CAD. I do not personally worry about the stock price as I prefer the underlying fundamentals (Not selling until in the multiple dollars where I think it should be valued)

**Why I have invested in KABN:**

1. KABN **products** include the biometric/blockchain secured self sovereign identity, which allows for each user to control where their data is shared, when and how. A digital avatar platform that allows for simple linking to each application. A Visa approved Credit card, with a rewards program.
2. KABN **partners** include Loop Insights and involve many other companies from health care, school campuses, travel, and banking. They have also partnered recently with an AR company to improve their Liquid Avatar.
3. KABN **team** has many years of experience in each of their fields, from payment systems, online security, cryptography, and user interface.
4. KABN's **potential** value that is offered to both users and institutions with this technology is tremendous. KABN offers a security platform that other apps can interact with. Each digital identity will be tailored BY THE USER who chooses what information to give to each program (Facebook, banking, work, travel, healthcare).
5. KABN's **pipeline** is not only based on the work KABN is doing, but also in those companies which have partnered with them. As KABN offers the operating system in which these other institutions will interact on top of. Their Liquid Avatar is set to go live on February 18th
6. KABN's **finances** are incredible. Recently in December they made out to raise 1 million dollars and instead received 4 million dollars in both brokered and non-brokered financing.
7. **Who Financed KABN?** Non other than Robert Anson...Ceo of Loop Insights. Now this is the closest thing to insider trading I can possibly think of. This point here is in my mind crazy and I do not know why more people are not talking about them.
8. **22.5 million dollar market cap.....** 10x or 20x would not surprise me 

**Short up to date Explanation (10min)**: ""[s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pazfqVa6MUo)imple You tube search of KABN will pop one up""

**Other posts** KABN has had 0 opinion pieces posted about it in the last year. Not a single soul seems to know about KABN unless you are on the KABN Forums or follow the WallStreetReporter or Algoracom on you tube.

**Possible downsides:** The CEO David Lucatch has been working for many years in the online space and in doing so he has been the CEO of a few companies (Intertainment Media) that have failed. Not every company succeeds ever with the best leadership so I do not think this is a serious worry.

**History:** The company was created after the Facebook scandal with Cambridge Analytica for those who remember or have seen the movie **The Great Hack.** KABN did have a restructuring and rebuilding last year, doing a reverse takeover of Torino Power Solutions. **Ben Kessler** was the original **CEO of KABN** and after trying to get it off the ground they brought **David Lucatch** on board to steer the ship and **rebuild KABN products and partners**. Ben is still a company director at KABN.

KABN may have came to market to soon last year, and possibly with an unrefined user face. Now that general understanding of user data is growing and KABN has created the liquid avatar I think that the time is now for KABN to succeed.

Realizing I cannot have links in this post so I will describe what I originally had. A simple search should bring most of the links up.

**Website: The KABN website**

**Partners:** ""XTM joins consortium of partners""

""[I](https://kabnsystemsna.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PRESS-RELEASE_KABN-Liquid-Avatar-Imagine-AR-Release_Final-for-January-12-2021-final.pdf)magine AR partnership"" (they have an ugly logo I must say)

**Pipeline:** ""[l](https://kabnsystemsna.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/January-26-2021-Liquid-Avatar-App-Store-Release-date-FINAL.pdf)iquid avatar""

**Who** **Financed KABN:** ""Robert Anson KABN non-brokered""

**History: A reddit post from last year (Before a rebuilding and restructuring)**

""A year old post in reddit giving a description of what KABN was at the time"" **(CEO Ben Kessler at the time)**

2017-03-10 17:49:47,Kootenay Zinc gets DTC eligibility,PureNobody76,1,"Mr. David Schmidt reports

KOOTENAY ZINC CORP. ANNOUNCES DTC ELIGIBILITY OF ITS OTCQB-LISTED COMMON SHARES & FRANKFURT LISTING

Kootenay Zinc Corp.'s common shares trade on the OTCQB, a U.S. interdealer quotation system, under the symbol KTNNF. The Company's common shares will also continue to trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange under its trading symbol ""ZNK"". In connection with the OTCQB listing, the Company obtained DTC eligibility with the Depository Trust Company for its common shares on the OTCQB. The Depository Trust Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. and manages the electronic clearing and settlement of publicly traded companies. Securities that are eligible to be electronically cleared and settled through the DTC are considered DTC eligible. This electronic method of clearing securities speeds up the receipt of shares and cash, and thus generally accelerates the settlement process for investors.

Achieving DTC eligibility to simplify trading of the Company's common shares on the OTCQB market makes it accessible to an even broader range of investors and is expected to assist with the Company's goal of increasing the liquidity and convenience of trading its common shares within the U.S.

In addition, the Company announces that its common shares trade on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol ""KYH"" which should help increase the Company's shareholder base and provide increased access to the European capital markets.

About the Company

Kootenay Zinc Corp. is a mineral exploration and development company based in Vancouver, British Columbia that is presently targeting the Sully Property. The Company is focused on discovering large-scale sedimentary-exhalative (""SEDEX"") deposits.

The Sully Property comprises 1,375 hectares located approximately 30 kilometres east of Kimberley, B.C., and overlies rocks of similar age and origin as those which host the world-class Sullivan deposit, owned by Teck Resources Ltd. Sullivan was discovered in 1892, and is known to be one of the largest SEDEX deposits in the world. Over its 100-year lifetime, Sullivan produced approximately 150 million tonnes of ore, including approximately three hundred million ounces of silver, eight million tonnes of zinc and eight million tonnes of lead. The equivalent level of strata as at Sullivan and that formed on the margin of that same basin are present at the Sully Property. The Company cautions that past results or discoveries on proximate land are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved on the Sully Property.

The scientific and technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by the Company's Project Manager, Paul Ransom, P.Geo., a ""Qualified Person"" as defined in National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrocapStocks/comments/5ynioo/kootenay_zinc_gets_dtc_eligibility/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrocapStocks/comments/5ynioo/kootenay_zinc_gets_dtc_eligibility/
