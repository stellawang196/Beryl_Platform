2025-04-03 12:24:47,"Launched a Free API That Converts Raw Credit Reports to JSON: Unlock Legacy Data for ML, Risk Models & More Hello r/fintech!

​If you're looking to enhance your fintech projects with comprehensive credit report data, we offers a robust solution. Our API [creditparsepro.io](https://www.creditparsepro.io/) seamlessly converts fixed-format credit reports from major U.S. bureaus into structured, standardized JSON, unlocking a multitude of opportunities for financial innovation.​ To make testing our product painless, you can sign up for our [free tier](https://buy.stripe.com/5kA4iQ7B42LP3baeV5) with just an Email. Further, for a limited time our **Professional** plan completely [FREE](https://buy.stripe.com/00g7v25sW7256nm8wO).

Credit report analysis generally involves users scrolling an interface that makes it manageable. But have you seen what fixed-format credit reports look like on the backend?  Here is a single tradeline that represents only a fraction of a credit report. Many credit reports are over 10,000 lines long.

    TR01288Q 0202V002WLM P & F CU            I66666                   I2020042620240101V                         051000003817000006587         034M000000242                                    US            00         2024010105                                                        00      

If you want to start automating decisioning and training machine learning models on this data you need it in a structured format. Below you will see just a few of our fields in the structured join-format JSON:

        {
          ""account_number"": ""66666"",
          ""close_date"": """",
          ""credit_limit_amount"": 0,
          ""current_balance"": 3817,
          ""high_balance_amount"": 6587,
          ""is_open"": ""1"",
          ""last_payment_date"": """",
          ""maximum_delinquency_amount"": 0,
          ""maximum_delinquency_date"": ""2024-01-01"",
          ""monthly_payment"": 242,
          ""open_date"": ""2020-04-26"",
          ""original_balance"": 6587,
          ""past_due_amount"": 0,
          ""portfolio_type"": {
            ""key"": ""I"",
            ""value"": ""Installment account""
          },
          ""term"": 34,
          ""times_30_days_late"": 0,
          ""times_60_days_late"": 0,
          ""times_90_days_late"": 0

          ""installment"": {

            ""open_sum"": 7592,
            ""total_count"": 2
          },

You can expect MUCH more data and it doesn't matter if you are running TransUnion or Experian (Equifax in the future) you will get the same output format across bureaus.

You can run an example for yourself on our [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/34164250/2sA3BgBFus) no account needed. Just follow the link and scroll down to **v1/parse-report.**

**Key Features:**

* **Free Plan with Full Functionality:** Experience all features without limitations.
* **Broad Bureau Compatibility:** Our API supports various formats, including TransUnion's TU4.0 and TU4.1 FFR, and Experian's ARF, facilitating seamless integration across different data sources.
* **Unified Output Format:** Regardless of bureau and version/type all data returned will be in the same JSON structure so downstream systems will not need dynamic programming.

**Unlock the Potential of your Credit Data**

Many financial institutions operate legacy systems that generate or store vast amounts of historical credit report data in unstructured formats. Many of the common Loan Origination Systems (LOS) are notorious for this. By transforming this data into structured JSON we enable:

* **Credit Risk Modeling:** Develop more accurate risk assessments using structured data.
* **Automated Underwriting:** Streamline decision-making processes with reliable data inputs.
* **Fraud Prevention & Detection:** Enhance security measures by analyzing structured credit information.
* **Process Automation:** Reduce manual interventions and increase operational efficiency.
* **Enhanced Data Visualization & Reporting:** Gain clearer insights through improved data presentation.

**Getting Started is Simple:**

1. **Choose a Plan:** Select from our free (no credit card required) or paid subscriptions to suit your needs.
2. **Obtain your API Key:** Receive your unique key via email upon registration.
3. **Explore Documentation:** Access our comprehensive guides on [GitHub](https://github.com/granum-tech/creditparsepro/blob/main/docs/documentation.md) and [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/34164250/2sA3BgBFus) to help integrate seamlessly.",,reddit/fintech

I’m working on a tool to help finance professionals who regularly work with SEC filings and earnings call transcripts. The idea is to make it much faster to:
	•	Summarize key information from filings
	•	Detect changes between periods
	•	Ask direct questions and get sourced answers
	•	Spot missing or unusual disclosures (like missing share counts or hidden adjustments)

At this stage, I’m not selling anything — just trying to learn from people who regularly deal with filings.

If you are:
	•	An analyst
	•	Portfolio manager
	•	Equity researcher
	•	Accountant or auditor
	•	Financial journalist
	•	Or anyone who spends hours on filings

I’d love to know:

	2.	What would actually save you time or make the process less painful?

Hey everyone, I’m the creator of “F,” a system designed to tackle P2P fraud as a social issue, not just a tech problem, thought it’s tech heavy. F uses unique trust mechanics, education, and a fee-funded “X” (hidden) with the goal to cut fraud by 50%, saving $1B at $1T volume while generating $750M-$900M in revenue. It also can fund $44M in ESG education for 80M users at scale, creating a new approach to fraud prevention that aligns with a charitable cause as well.  

This could be a game-changer for large P2P platforms like PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App, which face 28% of FTC scam reports, as well as smaller players like Remitly or Prosper. It could also be Craigslist 2.0 for a visionary VC.

We’re experimenting with a new lending model:  
Users can borrow against their high-value items (watches, electronics, bags, etc.) without ever giving them up. The assets stay with the borrower.

The core stack:

* Machine learning for valuation
* Soft credit check for borrower screening
* Loans up to $5K/item at 18–22% APR
* P2P lending model on the backend, offering 8–10% to backers

We’re live in NYC and focused on two core problems:

1. Giving non-traditional borrowers access to credit
2. Creating safer P2P lending opportunities using real-world collateral

Would love feedback on the model — especially from other fintech folks who’ve built or funded lending platforms.

Firstly summarising the article in question, secondly extracting all assets mentioned in the text and providing sentimental summaries on the ideas related to them in the article. Thirdly, extracting key risks that are directly or indirectly addressed in the article. 

My issue is summaries can be very vague and even with careful prompting, the LLM model does not always extract details that may be important to the overall analysis of investment. So I was thinking of adding a notes capability where users, if interested, would be able to dig deeper into concepts and key words they find in the text from across other sources of data. But doing all this in a chrome extension seems computationally heavy (I may be wrong - it is my first chrome extension).

We’re now releasing the final feature in the next few weeks: a **custom notification system** that alerts you when:

* A transaction exceeds a set amount
* Your **checking or savings account balance** drops below a limit
* Your total loan balance goes over a threshold
* Your total assets exceed a target you define

You set the rules — the app does the monitoring.

One of my clients runs an e-commerce business and currently uses Stripe. But he’s not happy with the \~6% fee they take from each transaction, and now he’s asking me if we can build our own payment gateway so he can cut those costs.

While I understand financial systems at a low level, I’ve never built a Stripe-style gateway from scratch. I’m not even sure where to begin — what questions to ask, what’s realistically feasible, and what pieces need to come together technically and business-wise.

**What I’m trying to figure out:**

* What key questions should I ask my client to better scope this idea?
* What are the core components/features of a payment gateway I should understand?
* Are there existing solutions or APIs that could help us reduce fees without reinventing the wheel?
* What kind of compliance or regulatory stuff (e.g., PCI DSS) do we need to think about?
* Any solid resources or open-source projects worth exploring to get up to speed?

2025-03-22 22:57:53,"Question regarding Amazon Pay and Stripe Hey, I am trying to buy something from an online website that is not shady but not reputable. The checkout page took me to what supposedly is Stripe (I say supposedly because you never know it could be a dummy site). I did not want to directly put my card into this website so I pressed the amazon pay button. It took me to the legitimate Amazon pay website because I was able to sign out and then sign in with my Amazon credentials. When I went to finalize my purchase with my credit card over Amazon Pay two things stuck out at me.

""Your payment method will be saved for future purchases with this merchant"" and ""You allow the merchant to charge future purchases to your saved payment method"". My concern regarding the first quote is that I do NOT want Amazon to give my credit card number to the merchant nor stripe (as I don't completely trust thatit'ss not a dummy). Regarding the second quote, I am signing up for a monthly subscription that I don't know if I will be able to easily cancel from the seller's site.

Can II turn off recurring payments from Amazon's side or at least disable my saved payment method from the seller's point of view? Of course, this point would be muted if Amazon gave my credit card information directly to the seller. If it helps, I always remove my saved payment method after every purchase I make with Amazon.

Also, is [https://apay-us.amazon.com/](https://apay-us.amazon.com/)

 the legitimate URL for amazon pay and [https://checkout.stripe.com/](https://checkout.stripe.com/) the legit URL for stripe?

2025-03-21 19:56:24,"Extra phone for 2FA with modern banks—does it improve security? 
Hi everyone,

I’m thinking of leaving ""Sparkasse"" (Germany) to a ""modern"" bank like Trade Republic, N26, etc.,

But I have concerns about their approach to two-factor authentication. Unlike traditional banks that offer separate authentication methods (e.g., TAN via chip card with external device), these fintechs rely on a single device—typically a smartphone—for both banking and authentication.

To mitigate this risk, I’m thinking about using a second phone with a separate SIM card only for receiving authentication codes (SMS TANs), while keeping my main smartphone for actual banking transactions.

Would this setup improve security, or are there still significant risks I should be aware of? I’d love to hear your thoughts!",,reddit/fintech

2025-03-20 14:12:46,"Are We Entering a Wave of Fintechs Buying Banks? Two recent announcements—SmartBiz Loans' purchase of Centrust Bank in Illinois and U.K.-based OakNorth's agreement to buy Michigan's Community Unity Bank—highlight an ongoing push by digital banks and fintechs to gain traction in the U.S. banking sector.

🔹 SmartBiz Loans (Billfloat) had to wait nearly a year to gain BHC approval from the Fed, underscoring the regulatory scrutiny fintech-bank deals have faced in recent years. The OCC then approved changing Centrust's business model to let the buyer offer small-business lending nationwide.

🔹 OakNorth had already laid the groundwork for U.S. expansion, and it secured regulatory approval in August to open a New York representative office. Its acquisition of a relatively young bank signals that digital platforms remain eager to gain charters, establish traditional banking footholds, and find faster routes to scale.

💡 Why Are More Fintechs Looking to Buy Banks? 

Several factors could drive more deals like these in the months ahead:

✔️ **Pressure on BaaS Partnerships**: Regulatory scrutiny on sponsor banks and Banking-as-a-Service models could force fintechs to explore bank ownership.

✔️ **Faster Time-to-Market**: A bank charter unlocks greater flexibility, letting fintechs launch deposit products, lending services, and other offerings without relying on third-party partners.

✔️ **Small Banks Mulling Exits**: Rising compliance costs and margin pressure may push more community banks to view a sale as the best path forward.

✔️ **Shifting Regulatory Environment**: Signals from the White House suggest a potential easing of regulatory headwinds, which could clear the way for more nontraditional bank deals.

📌 Will Regulatory Approvals Become Easier?

Some industry observers expect merger approvals to accelerate as approval processes become more clearly defined. We're already seeing signs of regulatory optimism in the form of ILC applications from General Motors, Stellantis, and OneMain Financial. This suggests that fintechs, neobanks, and even non-financial companies could pursue more acquisitions to gain direct access to banking infrastructure.

🚨 Will we see a surge in fintech-bank deals, or will regulatory bottlenecks continue to curb enthusiasm?

Take contract reviews, for example—going through each clause and checking if it aligns with internal guidelines is a repetitive process that can eat up hours.

You can automate it using **Llamaparse** and a strong reasoning LLM like GPT-4o.

# Here’s how you can build one yourself:

1. **Upload your document** and the internal guidelines you want it to be reviewed against.
2. **Parse the document** using a tool like **Llamaparse** or **Docling** to extract structured text.
3. **Use a reasoning model** like **GPT-4o** or **Claude Sonnet** to analyze the document based on your guidelines.

If you prefer a **no-code** version where you can swap different parsers, models, or tweak the prompts—I've built one that’s free to use and customize.

Hi everyone,

I’m a computer engineering student in my final year, and I’m currently doing a long-term internship at a small company. In this role, I mostly work with Nortel-era log files, troubleshooting issues like failed auto backups, and receiving mentorship in my CCNA journey. This experience has allowed me to build a strong foundation in computer networks as I work toward certification. Since my position is fully remote, I sometimes feel isolated in my learning and have found myself losing focus a bit.

Recently, an opportunity has come up for an internship at a national bank in their Network Department. However, due to some policies, I’m not entirely sure what their work entails. I’ve heard from some advisors that banks may still use older technologies, which could limit my experience if I decide to transition to another role or company in the future.

Right now, I’m torn between staying with my current internship or moving to the bank. I’d really appreciate any advice or insights from those who have experience in similar situations. Thanks so much!",,reddit/fintech

\- Subscribers will receive virtual cards for payment purposes.

  
\- These virtual cards can be added to their Apple or Google Pay wallets for convenient checkout integration. Alternatively, they can manually input card details at checkouts.

  
\- The virtual card will remain locked until the subscriber manually indicates their intention to make a purchase (e.g., for cupcake/bakery-related products where Visa is accepted). The card will automatically lock every 15 minutes.

  
\- Upon card unlocking, the subscriber will input the transaction amount. Funds will be transferred from my company’s account to the subscriber’s virtual card to cover the transaction.

  
\- Upon purchase confirmation, the subscriber will upload a picture of the transaction receipt.

  
\- The funds will be sourced from the subscriber’s monthly or annual subscription, which covers 50% of a transaction, up to $2.50 per day. Subscribers will be responsible for the remaining balance for transactions exceeding this limit.

I’m in the B2B compliance sector and I've been talking to people working in payments and it seems like manual risk assessments are still the norm for a lot of companies? Some teams have built internal scoring models, others rely on checklists and some are trying to automate pieces of it. But across the board, it sounds like time-consuming and hard to scale are the common themes.



I'm so interested to know;

* What’s your process for client risk assessments right now? Manual, automated, mix of both?
* Do you feel like existing risk models actually capture real threats, or are they just a box-ticking exercise?
* If you could change one thing about how your company handles risk assessments, what would it be?

However that v1 model was pretty naive (trained using word tokens and random forest classifier), it has relative ""low"" accuracy. As we have a passion to build the best accurate categorization API, we have invested quite some time using the most advanced language model and embeddings technology to train the V2 model, in our test, it hugely improved the accuracy.

In V2, here are some notable changes:

1. Use the most advanced technology to train the neural net model.
2. Fine-grained category in return. (130+ categories vs 30+ categories in V1)
3. Input requires transaction objects (name, merchant, amount) rather than just names.

merchant, amount are optional but recommended to include for better accuracy.

Looking for product management career advice and feedback.

**Background**: So, I have a top MBA and work in the strategy team of a financial services player in the USA. Strategy work has been interesting but feels like there's no implementation / shipping + I want to work at the intersection of business and technology + want to maximize compensation -> this lands me on pivoting to product management as a career.



**Aim**: Ideally, I would like to do product management at a firm that is in a passion area like music streaming (Spotify etc.) or has high compensation (Big tech, growth stage pre IPO companies).



**The plan to get there**: Realizing I can't make the jump directly, the path of least resistance seems to be to stick with my current firm and pivot internally to product management, learn the skills and then find a role in passion or high comp company in 1-2 years, ideally after having been promoted one level internally as well.



**The meat of the matter:**

In the financial services firm I'm at, there seem to be different types of product managers -> the business type and the tech/digital type.



The business ones handle the core products (think banking products, lending, cards) and don't do traditional big tech product management.



The tech/digital ones are spread out all over. Some of them work on the consumer facing app website while others work on the digital delivery of the said banking products, while others work on internal tools. 



The business PMs also seem more central to the organization (i.e. on the critical path).



What type of product team should I aim to join? What is more lucrative from a career POV in the long term?



My gut says that going tech/digital PM with current firm for a few years -> transition into passion / high comp product firm is the way to go if I am looking for a legit PM career whereas if I want to stick with this firm and grow, I should pursue a business PM career.



Thoughts? Would love your feedback on the reasoning.",,reddit/fintech

Need your advices.

As a consultant/contractor, I've been working with several Canadian banks/fintech companies over the last decade. I've noticed they're struggling with some problems, around application processing / onboarding / automations. 

Most are using a mix of:

* Email chains for document collection
* Various forms - Google, Type, Paper, PDF 
* Manual work with multiple internal/external systems

As a techy with over 24yrs, I couldn't stop my itch. And started to build a B2B solution named [Consen.co](http://Consen.co) with: 

* Visual workflow builder (drag-and-drop) with integrations and few other automations support
* Application builder (json directed forms, Files upload etc.)
* Document generation from templates
* Task automation & routing for employees/agents
* Audit trails and rule-engine for compliance (was thinking about regulated domains)
* Integration capabilities (API/Webhooks)
* Multiple web fronts (Customer portal, admin console etc.)



Now, I know I broke all the startup best advices.- validate first, niche-down, get paying customers before you build it etc etc.

But... now I think it's really an usable solution. From my experience, I know it'll be hard to get Financial businesses onboard. :-)

But after putting so much effort into it, don't want to give up. Really want to make some traction now.

So, am asking the community for advice, GTM strategy or whether anyone wants to give it a shot?

We started by trying to feed complex regulatory PDFs into AI workflows. What we found was that many of these documents had highly structured layouts, scanned pages, and came in various formats.

2025-02-16 03:40:20,"How do fintech innovators find collaborators for their projects? Are existing tools enough? Hey fintech community!

As someone fascinated by the intersection of finance and technology, I’ve been thinking about how fintech innovators—whether solo developers, small teams, or startups—find collaborators to bring their ideas to life. Whether it’s building a payment gateway, creating a blockchain solution, or developing a personal finance app, collaboration is key—but finding the *right* person can be a challenge.

From what I’ve seen, most people rely on platforms like **LinkedIn** , **Upwork** , or niche communities on **Discord/Slack** . Others attend hackathons, fintech meetups, or lean on personal networks. While these methods work to some extent, they often feel clunky or incomplete when it comes to finding someone who’s truly aligned with your vision—especially in a specialized field like fintech.

So here’s what I’m curious about:

1. **Are existing tools effective for finding collaborators in fintech?**
   * LinkedIn is great for professional networking, but does it really help you find someone with the specific technical or financial expertise needed for a fintech project?
   * Upwork is awesome for hiring freelancers, but how well does it work for long-term partnerships or equity-based collaborations in fintech?
2. **What’s missing in the current landscape?**
   * Is there a gap in how these platforms facilitate trust, skill-matching, or shared goals in the fintech space?
   * Would features like verified credentials (e.g., certifications in blockchain, AI, or finance), project showcases, or collaboration-specific filters make a difference?
3. **Would you use a platform designed specifically for fintech collaboration?** Imagine a tool built to connect fintech innovators with complementary skills—developers, data scientists, financial analysts, compliance experts—who are looking to team up on shared ideas. It could include:
   * Skill-based matching tailored to fintech (e.g., blockchain development, regulatory tech, AI in finance)
   * A showcase for past projects or contributions (like a portfolio for fintech professionals)
   * Built-in communication tools to vet potential collaborators

Do you think this kind of platform would solve a real pain point, or do existing tools already cover this need?

I’d love to hear your thoughts—especially if you’ve faced challenges in finding collaborators for fintech projects or have ideas for features that could make the process smoother. Any feedback or personal experiences would be super valuable!

Thanks in advance for sharing your insights. Looking forward to the discussion!

My background is not in fintech, and I ran only a traditional business for the last year. So far, the most complicated and lacking areas in fintech are compliance (legal) and data engineering (too complex/bespoke for AI). These are my biggest expenses, and going with a provider that offers compliance completely eats into profit for several years, which will force me to raise money early. 

Are large payments companies just able to absorb the cost of compliance and data services, in order to create reliance on there services e.g., developer tools, issuing, banking etc.? Therefore smaller companies are over shadowed, or do not attempt to compete?

2025-02-13 05:09:46,"What Will Money Look Like in the Future? 
Will banks still control financial transactions? Will physical wallets become obsolete? Will AI and blockchain create a  #financialsystem where intermediaries are no longer needed?

The financial landscape is shifting faster than ever. Traditional models are being challenged by digital currencies, AI-powered financial decisions, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Those who adapt will thrive—those who ignore these shifts risk being left behind.

Having spent years at the forefront of #FinTech, collaborating with global networks like Visa and Mastercard, and local/international Banks, I’ve witnessed how financial systems evolve. Businesses are racing to integrate AI into lending decisions, #blockchain is reducing fraud and settlement times, and central banks are exploring digital currencies. But with progress comes complexity. 

How do businesses and professionals prepare for this new era?

Here are three key forces shaping the future of finance:

- The AI-Driven Financial Ecosystem – AI is making lending decisions, predicting market trends, and detecting fraud in milliseconds.
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi) vs. Traditional Banking – DeFi is removing intermediaries, and allowing direct peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and investing. 
- The Rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) – Governments are taking digital currencies seriously. 

These shifts are not distant possibilities, they are happening now. The question is: Are we ready for the financial systems of the future?

I’ve spent years analyzing these changes and will be sharing deeper insights in the coming weeks—including something I’ve been working on behind the scenes that consolidates these lessons into a practical guide. For now, I’d love to hear your thoughts. 

What do you think will shape the future of finance over the next decade?

While most insurance documents are obviously in English, there are also insurance documents in other languages such as Chinese and German. Automating such insurance documents is truly a challenge. One reason is the comparatively limited number of documents available in non-English languages to train automation platforms such as RPA, OCR, and IDP. Due to this, most document automation vendors don’t provide multilingual support. One approach is to replicate different variations of the available documents and use that data to train the systems for better results. However, for such use cases, a significant amount of manual effort is involved in the process, as it requires a trial-and-error approach, correcting each mistake the system makes until it is properly trained. Consequently, the number of vendors offering multilingual support for documents is quite limited.

I wanted to share my personal journey in hopes it might help or inspire some of you. I’m Sourabh—the Founder of CreditConnect. A few years ago, I was drowning in credit card debt, juggling multiple cards, and barely making minimum payments. Every financial app I tried fell short of actually helping me get out of debt in a clear, strategic way.

**My Turning Point**

Desperate for a solution, I took a deep dive into my spending patterns, interest rates, and payment timelines. Combining data analytics with common-sense budgeting, I developed a personal algorithm that prioritized which cards to pay off first. Amazingly, I saw my debt shrink significantly in just a few months, and my credit score climbed higher than ever.

Becoming the “Credit Specialist”

Friends noticed how quickly I improved my situation and started asking for help with their own credit cards. It became clear that millions of people share the same struggles I’d faced. That realization was the spark for building something bigger.

**The Birth of CreditConnect**

I decided to turn my approach into an app—[CreditConnect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ccai/id6502308971)—that anyone can use (currently on iOS, with Android in development). Here’s what it does:

**Demystifies Credit Card Debt** – Uses my proven algorithm to show exactly where your money should go first.

**Provides Personalized Insights** – Helps you see spending patterns and make more informed decisions.

**Offers a Virtual Assistant** – Trained on all things credit card-related to help you navigate which card is best for your needs.

And the best part: CreditConnect is completely free—no hidden fees or premium versions.

**Security & Privacy**

I know security and privacy are huge concerns for any financial app. That’s why CreditConnect integrates with Plaid, an industry-leading service used by top fintech companies to securely connect bank accounts. All your data is encrypted, and we never sell or share your personal information with third parties. I wanted to make a tool that helps people get out of debt without compromising their trust.

**Lessons I Learned**

**Track Everything:** Knowledge is power. Once I saw where every dollar was going, I could prioritize effectively.

**Focus on Interest Rates First:** It’s one of the fastest ways to reduce debt.

**Talk About Money:** Friends, family, or forums like this can offer moral support (and sometimes real-world tips).

**Consistency is Key:** Even small extra payments add up over time if you stick to them.

**Give It a Try**

If you’re on iOS, feel free to [download CreditConnect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ccai/id6502308971) and let me know what you think! It’s 100% free, and I genuinely hope it can help anyone feeling as stuck as I once did. If you’re on Android, sit tight—the app is in development, and I’ll share updates soon.

I’m here to answer any questions, whether it’s about the strategies that worked for me, the virtual assistant feature, or how I built the app. We’re all on this journey together!

**TL;DR:**

I overcame significant credit card debt using a strategy I developed myself. That method turned into CreditConnect—a free, secure iOS app that breaks down debt repayment, offers personalized insights, and includes a virtual assistant to help you choose the right credit card. We use Plaid to keep your financial data secure, and we never sell or share your personal information. Android version is on the way! Let me know if you have any questions.",,reddit/fintech

2025-02-09 04:19:15,"How common are financial ledger issues? I used to run a marketplace where we needed to track user balances so that balances accurately reflected the money we owed the users. 

We used two companies to manage our ledgers and payouts. ""Company1"" was an API/cloud service that managed the credit card gateway and tracked transactions and user balances. We also used ""Company2"" which housed our funds and had an API to initiate the user payouts. Both companies would make costly mistakes that shocked me.

Company1 would completely miscalculate the ledger. So, for example, when users were owed $60k in one day, the company accidentally put $120k total in the ledger because they double counted the daily batch. This is just one example of the many types of ledger mistakes they made. I had weekly and semi-weekly emergencies like this with them. 

Company2 would make mistakes where we'd send them an API request to pay out a user. The API would return a 400 error, so we'd retry multiple times. Then the company would email us saying the 400 response was wrong; the payments were, in actuality, successful, and they paid the user three times. Again, this mistake is only one example of the daily issues we had.

I'm not sure if I should name the companies because maybe we had an unusual situation. I never had these types of issues with Stripe, though Stripe has its fair share of issues, but I couldn't use them for this project.  
  
Is it common to have ledger issues like this? I feel like these are major errors that shouldn't happen, and could have easily been prevented with better code. But the issues were so prevalent with both companies that it felt like it must be normal. It makes me so nervous to run any company with payouts. How do you ensure these mistakes don't happen?

2025-02-08 17:08:15,"Fintech Needs AI, But Not Like This 💸🤖 I’ve been working in ML for a while, and the more I look at fintech, the more it feels like a perfect use case for AI done right. But instead, I keep seeing companies defaulting to LLMs for problems where they make zero sense.

Risk scoring? Fraud detection? Credit underwriting? These are structured data problems. But somehow, companies are throwing massive language models at them, burning compute and racking up cloud bills for tasks that could be handled by smaller, faster, and more explainable models.

One of the biggest challenges in fintech is data availability. You can’t just take customer transactions or loan applications and dump them into a model—privacy laws, compliance, and data scarcity make training difficult. That’s why synthetic data generation could be a game-changer. If we can generate high-quality synthetic datasets that reflect real-world financial patterns, AI in fintech becomes way more accessible—startups could train models without needing huge proprietary datasets, and companies could test AI strategies without compliance nightmares.

That’s why my co-founder and I built [smolmodels](https://github.com/plexe-ai/smolmodels)—an open-source tool that lets you generate lightweight, task-specific AI models fast, even with synthetic data.

The fact that fintech is still struggling with AI adoption makes no sense to me. Regulatory concerns, data availability, and deployment complexity shouldn’t be blockers. AI models don’t need to be massive to be useful—they need to be accurate, interpretable, and efficient.

Would love to hear from others—what do you think is stopping fintech from using AI properly?",,reddit/fintech
2025-02-08 15:28:50,"P2P Lending Is Broken – I Built a Solution That Affects CIBIL Score **The biggest issue in P2P lending? No real accountability.** Borrowers take loans and sometimes **disappear**, leaving lenders with **zero security**. Why? Because there’s no real consequence for defaulting.

So, I built something different—a P2P lending app where **loan repayments directly impact the borrower’s CIBIL score**. This ensures **real trust and accountability** in personal lending.

💡 **Why This Is Needed:**

* Traditional P2P lending is risky—borrowers can vanish
* Lenders hesitate to trust unknown borrowers
* A system is needed where **borrowers feel the responsibility to repay**

🚀 **How It Works:**

1. **One-time KYC during signup** for security
2. **Lend/borrow only within trusted networks** (friends, family, verified users)
3. **Set clear loan terms** (amount, tenure, interest)
4. **Real-time tracking of repayments**
5. **Missed payments affect CIBIL score**, ensuring true financial responsibility

🎁 **Extra Features:**

* **Scan & pay, UPI transfers, bill payments**
* **A shop where users earn coins for transactions**

🔍 **The Big Picture:**  
If P2P lending is backed by **credit score accountability**, more people would lend safely, and borrowers would take loans seriously.

I’ve designed and structured this product, focusing on solving the trust issue in P2P lending. Development is the next step, and I’d love to hear insights from the community. Would this solve trust issues in lending? Let’s discuss!

2025-02-06 01:58:59,"Transaction classification challenges and solutions Hey all, thought I'd make a quick post outlining some of the challenges I've had to overcome / am still stumped on when it comes to classifying transactions.

The reason I started this project was I didn't want to manually categorize my transactions anymore, wanted greater visibility into my business spend, and found that most budgeting apps do really poorly with categorization. around ~80% of transactions were off for most of them.

So I've been building this system to categorize them myself and I wanted to see what you think about the challenges I've faced with it and the solutions I've come up with.


# 1. Classification Algos

I found most open source classification algos did a good job with larger vendors (Amazon, Spotify ... ) but failed with things like a local grocery store.

So I used a combined system of a classical classification algo for the larger vendors and for the more niche vendors I've leveraged an LLM + web searching to augment the transaction with relevant data for it's classification.

This brought the number of correct classifications up to 90-95% correct.

# 2. Transactions are too low resolution

How can you categorize a place a transaction at Walmart or Costco? Is it grocery, pharmacy, department store, ... ?

Transactions simply don't have enough information sometimes.

Most of the time it's pretty 1:1 - Starbucks == Coffee

but for cases like these, I think the only solution is to take pictures of receipts.

However, as I work to turn this into something that other people can use - the UX just doesn't make sense for most people. Taking a picture of your receipt is possibly too cumbersome for most.

# 3. Search data

I've opted to use google custom search for getting the data to classify the vendor better.

but there's a few other possibilities
### 1. Google Business Profile APIs
- pros:
  - very accurate, and concise - two things LLMs need for good output
  - seemingly has most businesses
- cons:
  - very expensive ($0.025 / per call)

### 2. SerpAPI
- pros:
  - similar data
  - slightly less expensive
- cons:
  - but still also very expensive (~0.015 / per call)

### 3. Brave Search
- pros:
  - very cheap
- cons:
  - not as accurate or concise

I imagine I must be missing something here, surely there's a better API / data set that can map more niche places no?


Anyways, hope someone can get value out of this post. It's been an interesting project, finally getting to the point where it's becoming pretty useful for my personal needs.

2025-02-05 17:55:36,"Building a Community Before or After MVP? Need Your Advice! I’ve been working on something I’m really excited about, and I could use some advice from this awesome community. 🙌

Here’s the deal:

We’re building a **personalized AI-powered fintech app** to help kids (ages 8–18) learn real-life financial skills—things like saving, spending wisely, and even investing in stocks or crypto. Think of it as a modern financial coach for kids, but with gamified features like in-game currency, unlockable lessons, and parental controls to keep everything safe and supervised.

The problem we’re solving is simple: Platforms like Greenlight help kids manage money, but they don’t provide personalized insights or teach them how to make smarter financial decisions. Our goal is to fill that gap by combining AI recommendations with fun, engaging tools that kids actually want to use.

But here’s where I’m stuck:

**Should we focus on building a community NOW (before our MVP is ready), or wait until the product is live?**

On one hand, having a strong community from day one seems like it could make launching the MVP smoother. People would already be invested in the vision, and we’d have early adopters ready to test things out. Plus, communities often drive organic growth way better than traditional marketing.

On the other hand, I don’t want to waste time and energy building a community if we don’t have anything tangible to show yet. Maybe it’s smarter to focus all our resources on finishing the MVP first and then rallying people around it.

What do you guys think?

Here’s what I’m considering:

* **Option 1:** Start small and build a tight-knit community now. Share updates, gather feedback, and create buzz around the problem we’re solving.
* **Option 2:** Focus 100% on the MVP, launch it, and THEN start building the community around the live product.

I know there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but I’d love to hear your thoughts based on your own experiences. Have you ever tried building a community pre-MVP? Did it work, or was it a distraction?

Also, if you’re a parent or someone who’s passionate about financial literacy for kids, I’d love to hear what challenges you’ve faced when teaching kids about money. It might help us refine our approach!

2025-02-05 15:15:16,"Using Blockchain for Internal Money Systems in Organizations - Thoughts and Feedback? Hey everyone,

I’m a computer science student, and I’m currently working on a project that is exploring the uses of blockchain to build an internal money system for organizations. The idea is to use blockchain to handle financial transactions within a company, everything from department-to-department transfers to payroll, while taking advantage of the transparency and security that blockchain offers.

Here’s what I’m thinking:

* With blockchain’s, every internal transaction would be recorded in a way that’s tamper-proof, offering total transparency for internal financial operations.
* Using blockchain’s smart contract capabilities, I’m hoping to automate processes to save time and reduce human error.
* Blockchain could help keep real-time track of funds across departments and provide an easier way to monitor cash flows and expenses across an organization.

Some potential uses:

* Instead of the usual bank transfers or internal ledgers, blockchain could streamline payments between departments, saving on transaction fees and delays.
* Especially for companies with global teams, blockchain could potentially handle payroll more efficiently and with fewer fees.
* Automating and tracking expenses in real-time could help prevent fraud and improve overall financial oversight.
* Blockchain could make managing the flow of funds between departments much smoother and more transparent.

I’m curious to hear if you think blockchain could be a good fit for internal systems like these. What do you see as the biggest challenges with using blockchain in this context? Scalability? Adoption? Would love to hear any examples of companies trying something similar or ideas on how to make it work in real-world scenarios.

I am broke. I have $1.10 and being able to get to work tomorrow depends on me receiving a pay-out from my contractee. Zelle has $1,250 of my money and says they ""don't see it on their end"" even though it is clearly visible on my end, senders have (all) been charged.

Just spent about 2 hours on the line with customer service & after having to b-tch at 23 people to receive any kind of real answer, I was told the best they can do is ""initiate a claim"" and that they will call me back ""within ten business days."" 

I should also state, it is unfathomable how non-existent support is. I had to call, call again, call again, call again, call again, rolling the dice until I hit someone who would actually do ANYTHING as opposed to reading a 2-line ""we're sorry"" copy-paste answer that had NOTHING to do with me or my concerns. By the end, I was ready for the aliens to just nuke & annihilate the planet, because obviously humans are grotesque & useless creatures.

This service is bricked. Beware, do not use zelle. They will arbitrarily hiccup and take your money. 

This service is supposed to be functional in cases of emergency, this is supposed to replace a cash/check transaction. They are not capable of rendering that service, and what's more - they will claim that they are not responsible?

I don't know WHAT larger institutions were thinking integrating this dumpster-fire into online banking. If I could look the people responsible in the eye right now, I would hold them down and obliterate their scrotum with my fists. This kind of delay can, and probably eventually will, cause someone's death. What if you were waiting on a payment to bribe your way out of a hostage situation with cartels in Colombia? What if you were in prison in Ghana, trying to make bail before being tossed into the cage with gen pop? 

This is not acceptable behavior when handling people's money. I have so many words for these bastards...

2025-01-29 14:50:07,"Would This Gamified Financial Literacy App for Kids Fill a Market Gap? Hey  👋 I’m brainstorming a product aimed at solving financial literacy for Gen Alpha (kids 8-18) by blending gamification, AI, and real-world tools. Existing platforms like Greenlight feel outdated—they lack adaptive learning and true engagement for digital-native kids. As fintech folks, I’d love your take: **Does this MVP concept have legs?** 





**Core Features**

1️⃣ **AI-Driven Financial Coaching** 

\- Algorithms analyze spending/saving habits to generate personalized:  

   \- Savings goals  

   \- Spending plans  

   \- Mock investment suggestions (stocks, crypto, ETFs) based on ROI + trends (think “Wealthfront for kids”).  

\- Uses behavioral economics principles to nudge better habits.  



2️⃣ **Gamification That Teaches**

\- Kids earn in-game currency by hitting savings goals or completing financial literacy modules.  

\- Currency unlocks features (e.g., “invest” in a simulated stock market, crypto, or NFTs).  

\- Parents/guardians set chores tied to rewards (auto-deposited post-completion).  



3️⃣ Parental Control Layer

\- Approve transactions over \[$X\] and block unknown senders (combatting finfluencers/SMS scams).  

\- Real-time notifications + transaction analytics (location, merchant, category).  



4️⃣ Tech Stack Integration

\- Physical + virtual debit cards (FDIC-insured partner).  

\- Supports Apple Pay, PayPal, Zelle (grandparent-friendly deposits).  

\- APIs for future expansion (open banking? crypto wallets?).  



5️⃣ Safety & Compliance

\- SOS alerts + location sharing (for emergencies).  

\- COPPA/GDPR-compliant by design.  

Why This Could Work

\- Kids learn by doing: Simulated investing, earning currency, and unlocking content mirrors gaming mechanics (high retention potential).  

\- Parents stay in control: Granular permissions without micromanaging.  

\- Scalable: Features like AI coaching could expand to teens/young adults later.  



**The Big Questions**

\- Market Fit: Is the parental control + gamification combo unique enough to disrupt Greenlight/Step?  

\- Tech Feasibility: How hard is it to balance COPPA compliance with features like simulated crypto?  

\- Monetization: Subscription model? Partnering with banks?  

\- Risks: Over-gamification diluting learning? Regulatory landmines?  





Example Use Case:  

A 12-year-old wants to buy Robux. Instead of instant gratification, the app:  

1. Recommends a savings plan.  

2. Unlocks a 3-minute lesson on “opportunity cost” after they save $20.  

3. Lets them “invest” part of their balance in a mock S&P 500.  

4. Parent approves the final purchase.  



Would this resonate with Gen Alpha? Or is it trying to do too much? 



Be Brutal:  

\- What features would you prioritize/drop?  

\- Are there technical hurdles I’m underestimating (e.g., real-time AI recommendations)?  

\- Would you let your kid use this?

2025-01-27 18:10:24,"A2A - will it really replace credit cards? A2A (account-to-account) payments are being hyped up—0 merchant fees, and instant settlement. But is this *actually* going to disrupt how we pay at checkout, I'm skeptical:

# Merchant-Consumer standoff

* **Merchants save \~80% on fees** but why should consumers care
   * No rewards, no chargebacks, no credit float. Just… a receipt.
   * Unless prices drop why switch from your cashback card?
* **Emerging markets** like Brazil (Pix) and India (UPI) prove A2A works *where cards aren’t entrenched*. But in the US/EU swiping is effortless.

# The UX Problem

* **Tapping a card**: 1 second.
* **A2A at checkout**: Open app → Scan QR code → Authenticate → Confirm.
   * *Developers:* How hard is it to retrofit this into legacy POS systems? Will it require some new form of card from banks replacing normal Visa/Mastercard cards?
   * *Startups* are pushing ""Pay by Bank"" buttons, but will Starbucks or Walmart ever prioritize this over their rewards apps?

# The Regulatory Wildcard

* **Europe** has PSD2 and instant payment mandates. **India** forced discounts for UPI users.
* Will governments push A2A adoption, or let Visa/Mastercard keep their monopoly?

**TL;DR**: A2A solves a merchant problem, not a consumer one. **IMO**: until refunds, rewards, and UX match cards, swiping isn’t going anywhere. Any hot takes?

**Background:** My background is broadly defined by sales. I started my career working as a Management Trainee and then Inside Sales Representative for a commercial plumbing wholesaler for 7 years. Here I learned all about quotations, procurement, purchasing, warehousing, shipping, alongside all the typical skills you would expect from an inside sales role. 

Next I transitioned into the world of Fintech by taking a B2B account manager role where I conducted demos and full sales cycle to onboard clients to a digital spend management platform. After a year I was promoted, responsible for ramping strategic accounts and mitigating churn, but ultimately ended up doubling up with all my prior enrollment and user-onboarding responsibilities due to layoffs. Ended up managing more than 3,000 accounts so I had to create and implement scalable tactics to streamline enrollment, ramping, and churn mitigation. All the while our product was stagnant with little to no innovation coming from engineering plus our main lead source dried up. I feel that what was once a premier solution that I was very proud to be a part of, is being overtaken by its competitors. I am not in a position to be able to tackle the lead-gen problem or convince the company to allocate resources to update the product so think it's time to search for a new role.

**What I love:** I love personal finance and technology/ecommerce. I love interacting with people and being client-facing although I believe I could get that same satisfaction as long as I'm part of a collaborative team. I am very detail oriented and love diving into the nitty gritty to refine a product/process so that it's as close to perfect as we can get. In my next role I would like to build a technical expertise and be able to influence the product. 

**What I don't love:** I do NOT enjoy cold prospecting and lead-gen, although I have experience in this area and can do it in moderation. Most of my success in growing a book of business has been from engaging with hand-raisers/form fills and building out referrals/partnerships. 

My current OTE is $140k but realistically earning $110-125k.

**The ask!:** Some job roles I've explored and found interesting are those of a sales engineer, solutions consultant, and in customer success but I'd really like to get recommendations on what you think might be interesting or a good fit! Please feel free to submit any job listings, recommendations, or reach out to me directly if you'd be interest in chatting and swapping stories

2025-01-22 21:24:42,"How to Start an Electronic Bank and Payment Gateway Targeting Underserved Markets? Hi everyone,

I’m exploring the idea of starting an electronic bank and payment gateway, specifically targeting markets with limited competition, such as certain African regions where payment gateways are scarce and banks charge high fees for prepaid Visa/Mastercard cards. My goal is to provide affordable, accessible financial services, including:

1. **Issuing prepaid Visa/Mastercard cards** with lower fees.
2. **Providing international IBANs** in USD, EUR, or other currencies as needed.
3. **Building a payment gateway** that supports local and international transactions.

**Here’s what I’m trying to figure out:**

1. **Should I separate the bank and payment gateway into two entities or combine them into one?**
   * Combining them might streamline operations, but separating them could offer more flexibility and compliance benefits.
2. **What are the key requirements to start such a project?**
   * Licensing, partnerships with card networks (Visa/Mastercard), compliance with PCI DSS, and integration with banking systems.
3. **What infrastructure is needed?**
   * A robust payment gateway platform, fraud detection systems, and APIs for seamless integration with banks and merchants49.
4. **How can I ensure affordability and accessibility?**
   * By reducing transaction fees, supporting multiple currencies, and offering user-friendly interfaces for both merchants and customers14.

**Why this market?**  
Many African regions lack reliable payment gateways, and banks often charge exorbitant fees for prepaid cards. By addressing these gaps, this project could empower businesses and individuals with affordable, secure financial tools14.

**Questions for the community:**

1. Has anyone here built a similar project? What challenges did you face?
2. Are there specific regulations or partnerships I should prioritize for African markets?
3. Any recommendations for payment gateway providers or APIs that support multi-currency transactions?
4. Should I focus on building the bank and gateway separately or as a unified system?

Loan Calculator [www.profithindsight.com/loan](http://www.profithindsight.com/loan)

If I borrow 1000 for 2 years at 5 % interest, I will be paying $43.87 per month for a total of $1,052.91 with $52.91 Interest

Savings Calculator [www.profithindsight.com/savings](http://www.profithindsight.com/savings)

We've spent the last few months working on an AI copilot for hedge funds — several are now using Zeno already (a mix between ChatGPT and the Bloomberg Terminal).

Now, we're making Zeno available to everyone. Why? Well, we think retail traders could really do with an AI platform to help them with their own portfolios.

**How to Use Zeno:**

* Ask any finance questions like you would to e.g., ChatGPT
* To reference a ticker, type $ followed by the company name (e.g., $Apple, $BTCUSD)
* Zeno will then generate a plan to tackle your question which you can then approve or modify before it proceeds with the analysis.
* Upload files for deeper analysis and interpretation.
* Save metadata or entire chats as white papers/presets (great for recurring workflows).
* Use the Tools page to modify workflows or assign functions.

**What Zeno Can Do:**

* Analyze stocks and companies (technical, fundamental, etc.).
* Aggregate news, summarize it, and gauge sentiment.
* Help build custom portfolios based on your criteria (e.g., mid-cap AI stocks).
* Perform data analysis (visual & numerical) and code generation for modeling.
* Answer general finance questions like any advanced LLM.

**All feedback (positive or negative) is greatly appreciated.**

I’ve noticed a few conversations here about AI and insurance, so I thought I’d jump in to share some thoughts—and I’d love to hear your take on this too!

Insurance processes have always been a bit of a headache, right? Claims, underwriting, compliance—it’s a lot of work and often feels like it takes forever. That’s where IDP is making a difference. Here are a few ways it’s shaking things up:

* **Sorting Documents Like a Pro**: Imagine not having to manually sift through piles of claims or policy forms. IDP can auto-classify and organize documents in minutes, saving loads of time and cutting out the tedious work.
* **Spot-On Data Extraction**: Whether it’s claims forms, contracts, or policy documents, IDP pulls out the details with laser precision. No more endless double-checking for errors.
* **Validation Made Easy**: Forget the back-and-forth over inconsistent data. IDP automatically cross-checks information, reducing mistakes and ensuring everything’s accurate.
* **Smarter Claims Processing**: From organizing claim files to spotting potential fraud, IDP speeds up the entire process, helping insurers work smarter, not harder.

What I find most exciting is how IDP doesn’t just make backend processes smoother—it genuinely elevates the customer experience. Faster resolutions and fewer mistakes mean happier policyholders.

So, over to you:

* Have you seen IDP or similar tech in action in insurance?
* What’s the next big challenge you think AI could tackle in this space?

Would love to hear your thoughts and learn from this amazing community! ",,reddit/fintech

I hold a Series 7, license from previous roles, so I know this space well. Currently at a fintech startup selling a wealth management platform to RIAs (Registered Investment Advisors). The product consistently breaks or gives wrong answers during demos even in our demo environment. Management is blaming me for lack of sales.  I am running the full sales funnel too.

Looking for: 

1. Reality check - is this actually my fault? 
2. Have any other fintech companies had severe product issues early on and eventually succeeded? 
3. Anyone been in similar situations - how did you handle it? 
4. How fast should I quit? 

Context: 

\- 16 years of successful sales experience in the RIA channel

\- Selling to RIAs who need reliable software for regulatory compliance

\- Product issues happen in EVERY demo

\- Even the demo environment fails consistently

\- Management seems to think better sales skills would fix this. The frustrating part is I know what RIAs need and what a working product should look like in this space. It's hard to maintain credibility with prospects when basic functionality fails consistently. Appreciate any insights, especially from others in fintech/B2B SaaS sales.",,reddit/fintech

2025-01-18 11:53:29," How can we use FinTech to help kids learn about money? Hey guys,

So, I’ve been thinking about how tech can actually make it easier for kids to learn about managing money. Honestly, schools don’t really teach this stuff, and it’s super important. Parents try, but it’s not always easy for them either.

**The Problem**

Kids don’t get enough real-life experience with money, especially in today’s digital world where everything is cashless. Parents want their kids to understand budgeting and saving, but they also need to make sure their kids don’t overspend or make bad money decisions.

Some apps are out there, but they have issues like:

* No proper parental controls (kids can move money around too freely).
* Lack of engaging features to actually keep kids interested.
* Expensive subscriptions that a lot of families find annoying.

**What I’m Thinking**

  
What if we had a FinTech app that actually solves these problems? Here’s my idea:

**1.Debit Card + Parental Controls:**

* Parents approve transactions and set limits, so kids can learn to spend safely.
* Real-time balance updates so there are no surprises.

**2. AI to Help:**

* AI tracks spending habits and suggests ways to budget better.
* It teaches kids about saving, taxes, and spending through simple advice.

**3.Make It Fun:**

Gamify the whole thing. Kids earn points for good money habits, unlock new levels, and even learn about stocks through a fun simulation game.

**What Do You Think?**

* Do you think this is something parents and kids would actually use?
* Is there anything specific you think we should include?
* If you’re a parent, how are you teaching your kids about money right now?

I’d really appreciate your thoughts. Let me know what you think about this idea!

2025-01-17 14:00:39,"Looking for an open banking platform for startup Hey Reddit,

I’m building a startup that helps event organizers sell tickets online in Belgium and the Netherlands. We charge a small fee per ticket, so keeping transaction costs low is crucial for us to remain competitive.

We’ve had difficulties finding the right payment solution. Many traditional providers like Stripe, Adyen, and Mollie either declined to work with us or required high revenue thresholds (e.g., €500k annually), which just isn’t feasible for a new business.

We believe **open banking** could be a game-changer for us. It’s cost-effective, transparent, and allows direct bank-to-bank transfers, letting us avoid the high fees of traditional payment methods like credit cards. We also need a provider that can hold funds in escrow until the day after an event and then release payments to the organizers.

The problem? Most open banking platforms seem to require high transaction volumes or large revenues, making it hard for startups like ours to get started.

Does anyone know of an open banking provider that’s willing to work with startups or small businesses? Any recommendations or advice would be incredibly helpful!

Thanks in advance for your insights!",,reddit/fintech

**3. Gamified Financial Ecosystems: Making Money Management Fun**

Financial education can be dull, but gamification will transform it into an engaging, rewarding experience. Future digital banks will deploy:

* **Daily challenges**: Encourage users to hit savings or spending targets for rewards.
* **Virtual reality (VR) simulations**: Let customers experience future financial scenarios, such as achieving a savings milestone or navigating economic downturns.
* **Reward systems**: Offer tangible benefits (e.g., cashback or interest rate reductions) for completing financial literacy quizzes or achieving budgeting goals.

**Detailed insight:** Picture a young couple managing their first joint account. Through an interactive VR platform, they simulate scenarios like buying a home or starting a family. These engaging tools teach budgeting skills while allowing them to visualize financial progress in real-time, creating a lasting impact.

 

**4. Biometric Payment Tattoos: The Next Step in Seamless Transactions**

This innovation combines convenience, security, and real-time feedback.

 

**5. Social Wealth Networks: A Community-Driven Financial Ecosystem**

Future banks will blur the lines between personal finance and community-driven growth through **social wealth platforms**:

* **Peer-to-peer savings groups**: Enable collective savings and shared interest benefits.
* **Crowdfunding for shared goals**: Let customers pool funds to co-invest in ventures or achieve community milestones.
* **Skill-based marketplaces**: Facilitate exchanges where customers trade services or surplus funds instead of currency.

**Detailed insight:** A social wealth network could unite local communities for co-investment in renewable energy projects. Through transparent blockchain technology, contributors track returns while achieving shared environmental goals. This approach fosters financial empowerment and collective responsibility.

 

**6. Predictive Life-Event Banking: Financial Solutions Before You Need Them**

Banks of the future won’t wait for customers to ask—they’ll anticipate needs using **AI-driven predictive analytics**:

* Automatically recommending college funds when a customer’s child is born.
* Pre-approving home loans as customers approach key life milestones like marriage or promotions.
* Alerting customers to potential gaps in retirement planning years before they arise.

**Detailed insight:** Consider a single professional receiving tailored investment advice as they approach mid-career milestones. The bank’s predictive AI aligns their savings with future priorities, offering a mix of property, equity, and retirement investment options before major life events occur.

 

**7. Digital Twin Financial Advisors: A Virtual You**

Imagine a **digital twin**—an AI-powered replica of yourself trained to mimic your financial behavior. These virtual advisors would:

* Simulate financial scenarios to predict long-term outcomes of decisions.
* Offer personalized advice aligned with your habits, values, and goals.

**Detailed insight:** A digital twin analyzes the financial impact of early retirement plans for a professional. It simulates how various decisions—like downsizing a home or transitioning to part-time work—would influence long-term savings, empowering the user to make confident, informed choices.

 

**8. Zero-Currency Banking: A New Value Economy**

Digital banks will lead the shift toward value-based economies, creating platforms where **currency isn’t king**:

* Rewarding customers with ""value units"" for volunteering, skill-sharing, or sustainable practices.
* Facilitating barter-like exchanges between users, backed by blockchain for transparency.
* AI converting these ""value units"" into monetary equivalents when needed.

**Detailed insight:** Picture a freelance graphic designer earning value units by offering services to a local community center. These units are later used to pay for childcare services, creating a balanced, sustainable exchange system that bypasses traditional currency.

* Rewards for adopting sustainable behaviors, such as energy-efficient home upgrades.

**Detailed insight:** A family planning to renovate their home receives a personalized loan package that incentivizes energy-efficient upgrades. As they make eco-friendly purchases, their loan interest rates drop automatically, reflecting their commitment to sustainability.

 

**10. Holographic Banking Interfaces: A New Dimension in Banking**

Screens will become obsolete as holographic technology enables:

* **Virtual consultations**: Meet with financial advisors as 3D holograms in your home or office.
* **3D portfolio visualizations**: See your financial assets in interactive, multi-dimensional charts.
* **Gesture-based controls**: Manage accounts and make payments with simple hand movements.

**Detailed insight:** Imagine an entrepreneur planning their annual budget using a holographic interface. With a few gestures, they adjust financial plans, visualize cash flow forecasts, and simulate the impact of hiring additional staff, all within a fully interactive, immersive experience.

Banks will leverage advanced data analytics to create personalized loyalty programs:

* Tailored rewards based on individual spending and saving habits.
* Partnerships with brands for exclusive offers, such as discounts on frequently purchased items.
* Dynamic adjustments to reward structures based on customer behavior.

**Detailed insight:** A frequent traveler might earn additional air miles for every financial transaction, while an environmentally conscious customer could receive rewards for eco-friendly purchases. Such programs increase customer engagement and retention.

 

**15. Augmented Reality (AR) Financial Tools**

Augmented reality will transform how customers interact with their finances:

I’m exploring a new way to send small amounts of money (like $5 or $10) across borders—practically as easy as sending a text. Think of it like buying a coffee for a friend who’s living abroad.

# What’s the Problem We Want to Solve?

* **High Fees:** Many traditional methods charge you $10–$40 just to send $30. That’s pretty painful if you only need to send a little.
* **Slow Processing:** Sometimes it takes days for a transaction to clear. And weekends? Forget it.
* **Frustrating Details:** Bank info, SWIFT codes—too many hoops to jump through for smaller sums.

# What We’re Proposing

* **1.** Ultra-low fees for sending tiny amounts (like $5–$50).
* **2.** Quick transfers—within minutes, regardless of weekends or banking hours.
* **3.** Extremely simple UX: possibly just a link or phone number.

*(We’re keeping the technical details under wraps for now—just imagine a faster, more affordable channel to send or receive funds.)*

# Questions for You

1. **Have you ever wanted to send or receive small amounts (under $50) across borders?**
2. **What’s your biggest pain point with current solutions (PayPal, Western Union, bank wires, etc.)?**
3. **If there was a way to send a few bucks without all the bank hassle, would you use it?**
4. Any red flags if it involves new tech (like digital wallets)? Or is cost and speed all that matters?

I’m working on a project to solve something that frustrated me during my year-long internship at a bank: digging through endless earnings reports (10-Qs, 10-Ks, etc.). It was time-consuming and honestly pretty draining.

So, I’m building a tool in Python that automatically summarizes these reports and lets you dig deeper into specific sections—kind of like having a conversation with the document. I’m also adding a feature that auto-generates charts and visuals from the data to make analysis quicker and easier.

After that internship, I got really interested in machine learning and have been studying it since. This project is part of that learning process, but I want it to actually be useful for people in finance.

If you’re a financial analyst, in wealth management, or just someone who works with earnings reports, I’d love your thoughts:

* What features would make this tool a game-changer for you?
* Which parts of earnings reports do you focus on the most?
* Would auto-generated charts help, and if so, what kind of visuals would you find useful?

Any feedback would be super helpful. Feel free to be as detailed as you want—I’m all in on making this as useful as possible.

I'm considering building a tool to help developers validate their compliance implementation - BEFORE production.

**The problem I'm trying to solve:**

* Currently, you either pay $15K+ or guess if your KYC implementation is correct
* No way to test against real-world scenarios before going live
* Documentation and best practices are scattered or behind paywalls

**The idea:**  
A developer-first platform that lets you:

* Test your KYC implementation against pre-built scenarios
* Validate against current regulatory requirements
* Get specific feedback on implementation issues
* All before spending money on production API calls

**Questions:**

1. Is this something you'd use?
2. What would be the most valuable features?
3. What scenarios would you want to test?

I’m doing  discovery work and would love to hear about the processes your team goes through to ensure your content, marketing, and sales materials meet securities compliance standards.

From my initial conversations, I’ve learned that it’s often a manual process:

* Sales or marketing teams draft the materials.
* These are sent to a compliance team member for review.
* Feedback loops ensue, sometimes going back and forth multiple times.
* The whole process typically takes 1–3 days from draft to approval/publishing.

Does this sound familiar? Or does your team approach it differently?

I’m especially interested in:

* What works well in your process?
* What are the biggest challenges or pain points? and how often do they occur?
* Are there any tools or workflows you’ve found particularly helpful?

2025-01-12 16:50:37,"What are the average metrics of an order book? Hi all,

  
I'm writing an order matching engine, and I'm at a point where I'm working on performance optimisation.

  
For that I generated a dataset of 10 million order creation requests, of which 1 million result in a trade and I used pretty much arbitrary order size and type distributions.

  
As it can have an impact on performance, I'd like to know if there is any publicly available information on REAL-WORLD metrics such as:

\- Average order size

\- Distribution of order sizes

\- Distribution of order types (market, limit, FOK, IOC, SL, OCO and so on)

\- Average order TTL - i.e. how long on average would a, say, limit order stay in the book before it's either filled or canceled

\- Stats on order modification (cancelations, price changes, amount changes)

  
...And any such metrics.

  
Analyzing available live order books on Binance and such didn't help very much. When a trade is broadcast, I have no idea of most of the metrics relevant to it. The taker order could be a market order hitting the book or could be an IOC limit one, the maker order could be an iceberg / shmiceberg / etc, or an OCO order, well basically there's little info other than that a trade has been created and maybe L2 values changed a bit.

Imagine a small business located in the USA. It has an app/website and social media presence (Insta, YT, FB, TikTok) etc.

The business wants to test using one giveaway per week (total 52 for next one year) as one of their marketing and customer loyalty strategy.  Users come across from multiple countries (eg. USA, Japan, Australia, UK, India, Vietnam, Thailand etc. represent majority of users).

In the giveaway they want to send users a cash gift of $10 - $50 ( in the currency of respective countries).

1. Is there any single solution to achieve this ? eg. Google Pay or PayPal account ? Google Pay has some country to country limitations. So it may not allow to send money from one country to all other countries. In such case, what are the possible solutions ?
2. If there is no single method, what is the minimum number of solutions that will need to be used - consider for these countries only - USA, Japan, Australia, UK, India, Vietnam, Thailand
3. For such a small amount, would there be country specific regulations that the business must follow - eg. will it need to provide any tax documents etc to the recipient/winner of the giveaway?

2024-12-27 17:12:23,"Asking for an advice about a decision making assistant. About a year ago I and my business partner founded RangeTeller - a fintech startup that enables banks to formulate and assess lending strategies.

The problem we solve is that every year banks reject millions of personal loan applications because the credit score of an applicant is not high enough. As a result, in the last decade banks have lost $50 billion of the personal loans market to fintech lenders.

Our solution is a framework which supports banks in formulating and assessing transparent lending strategies tailored to their specific goals: either identify creditworthy clients overlooked by the credit score system, or reduce risk by avoiding bad customers, or increase diversity of customers.

Using RangeTeller lenders can easily integrate their knowledge into a built-in ML framework. Unlike the credit score approach, RangeTeller is a multidimensional model, and the results are fully transparent and meet the highest compliance standards. Basically, RangeTeller is an extra Data Science team that works 24/7.

We have a fully functioning MVP. We did a successful case study with a data analytics startup specializing in alternative credit scoring. We have been accepted in the UK to the NatWest and to the Barclays Eagle Lab accelerator programs.

Judging by numerous indicators and testimonials we are on the right track in fintech. But in general our product is a decision making assistant, and therefore it can be used in different areas, for example in insurance. We are fintech professionals, but unfortunately we know next to nothing about insurance models. Moreover, there should be some areas where our product could be used, but we just don't know what they are.

We would like to know what those areas are, and how we could progress there. We would appreciate a feedback and an advice.",,reddit/fintech

2024-12-27 01:52:48,"Virtual Debit cards. Hi Guys, I am an entrepreneur and need guidance regarding digital payments. Before I can dive into what I am trying to develop I need to understand a few things. In the United States should you try to open a bank account, one of the key factors a bank usually needs is an address to open a bank account. Once an account is opened, you are given a debit card and should you want a credit card then you can apply for one. But I know that nowadays banks, do offer virtual card numbers for both debit and credit so that you can make payments online and of course use it with your Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.

These cards use Visa and Mastercard as payment processors to process payments. But here is my confusion as I have seen websites that offer virtual debit card numbers without entering any address but just an OTP and Mastercard or Visa sending them a virtual card number and no bank is involved. My question is how is that possible I am living in an x country but I am getting a virtual card through an app/website just using my phone number when I don't even reside in the respective country where the app is from.

Are Mastercard and Visa allowed to push out card numbers without an address?

If they are then what form of address are they using. Is it like one address is being used to offer multiple virtual cards to users on the site/app?

I am a noob and I am trying to understand the structure of how things work in digital payments realm. Hence any help is appreciated.",,reddit/fintech

2024-12-13 07:12:54,"Career in Fintech Hi everyone,

Long-time lurker here! Over the past few years, I’ve been immersed in startup environments, primarily in Operations and CX-focused roles. I’ve been fortunate to be paid fairly well, and for the past year, I’ve worked in the crypto-banking space in a BizOps/Founder’s Office capacity, spanning CX, risk, and operations. However, my current company is shutting down, and I’m transitioning into a Lead Ops role at another fintech firm, where I’ll be developing their CX framework for a UPI offering.

While these experiences have been rewarding, I’m now seriously considering pursuing an MBA in Singapore. My main motivation is to bridge gaps in my understanding of core finance and strategy, which I feel are critical for my career growth. I view the MBA as a stepping stone to acquire those skills and pivot into more strategic and product-focused roles.

I understand that opinions on the value of an MBA can vary widely, but I’m seeking advice on how my current experience could shape my career prospects during and post-MBA. I’ve always worked in dynamic, early-stage (Series A/D) environments, which required me to wear multiple hats beyond my primary KRA. This has helped me develop a problem-solving mindset and technical proficiency, often on par with or exceeding the PMs I’ve worked alongside.

Would my background in CX design, BizOps, and risk in startup settings make me a strong candidate for strategy and product roles at companies like Visa or Mastercard? Do companies like these value the kind of diverse experience that comes from working in startups, or would I need to specialize further to make the leap?

I’d appreciate insights from anyone who has walked a similar path or has experience navigating the MBA landscape for a career pivot.

2025-03-28 12:27:18,"Asset management on Wall Street Hi there, I’d like to hear some opinions from people in the industry on asset management on Wall Street. I’m 18, but I do hope to move to New York one day to start my own asset management firm after I graduate from university. 

When I say asset management, I mean a combination of both passive and active investing, similar to BlackRock and other famous asset managers.

I’m very fascinated by both value and growth investing in US and international equities, and have been reading many books on the subject. I’m also interested in how AI models and data-driven strategies can be applied here, especially since most of the quant strategies are mostly for short term speculative strategies and don’t provide deep insights into the long term value a company has. I hope to take a major in Data Science with a focus on Finance in university.

I’d like to find out the brutal realities of this industry. If one wanted to start an asset management firm focused on data driven value and growth investing, is prior experience working at other Wall Street firms necessary to get investors, or is a retail investing track record spanning say 10 years good enough?

If one wanted to get investors for such a firm, how hard is it usually? I want to know the cold hard truth. In Silicon Valley, you usually see Venture capital putting capital in almost any crazy idea, and you see many college kids getting millions in funding as soon as they graduate (this is obviously a major generalisation, but capital is much more actively allocated in Silicon Valley). I want to know if it’s the same on Wall Street.

If I wanted to get backing for an asset management firm, how do I convince investors, and how would I gain connections if I don’t plan on working long on Wall Street (if at all). Is a retail investment track record combined with proprietary software made specially for better insights into capital allocation a good enough sales pitch for the people on Wall Street to be convinced?

2025-03-20 14:41:59,"Looking to Connect with a  Hedge Fund Manager for Advice on New Quantitative Forecast Model for Short-Term Intra-Day Trades I have spent the past 7 years exploring the philosophical limitations of time series forecasting. The limited forecast horizon of time series forecasting is the consequence of the limited ways that human beings perceive time. Broadly, I have developed a new paradigm of time series forecasting that views seasonality as a quality of time, not of data, so it’s present in every set of time series data. Seasons in this paradigm are not limited to divisions of the calendar or the clock, and the application of irregular seasonal models makes it possible to identify patterns in historical data that are otherwise undetectable. 

I have no experience in the financial sector, but I believe that what I have developed can be described as a quantitative approach that identifies opportunity periods for short-term, intra-day trades. 

This approach considers the relative difference between the close price of a stock between two consecutive seasons. It addresses the direction of the change (up or down), not the magnitude of the change. Most seasons last a single day (and the seasonal models used for this approach consist of well over 1,000 individual seasons). The direction of the change is forecast for each season (up or down) and then **the odds of that forecast being correct** are presented based on the historic “hits” of the forecasts for that season. This approach can identify days with a greater than 70% chance of correctly forecasting the movement of the stock (close to close), with a  p value of less than 0.1 (less than 10% chance that the odds are random). 

Not every season is significant, and not every season occurs every year, so the number of opportunity periods for a given stock and a given quarter varies. 

This is an entirely quantitative approach and it can be applied to any set of time series data.

This image is an example of the Q3 2025 opportunity periods for IBM. 

[https://temporalinertia.com/images/IBM\_Q3\_2025.jpg](https://temporalinertia.com/images/IBM_Q3_2025.jpg)

It does NOT include the actual forecasts for each season — it’s simply the odds that the forecast for the season, up or down, will be correct or not. It also includes some historic context of the magnitude of the change related to the season — the minimum change, the maximum change, and the mean change. 

I believe this information could be of immense value to the right kind of investment manager. It can be used only for short-term trades, and I understand this is a small and specific strategy, and that even when funds do employ day trading, it constitutes a limited percentage of their overall approach.

Nevertheless, this data is not available with any existing tool. 

I have detailed, extensive research that illustrates the methodology, and I believe the statistical and mathematical principles of this approach are sound, because they’re simple and obvious. It’s the seasonal models that make this revolutionary. 

This stock forecast strategy is a small part of a much larger body of research. I have videos posted at [https://TemporalInertia.com](https://temporalinertia.com/) that provide more information about The Model of Temporal Inertia and the new approach to seasonality. 

I’m looking to connect with a hedge fund manager who incorporates short-term, day-trading strategies to help me understand if and how this strategy might be used. 

Please DM me if you would like to review the research related to the stock forecasts/opportunity periods. ",,reddit/hedgefund

What would make the most sense, and am I thinking about each measure correctly?

1. In terms of Gross exposure: Say my invested capital in a fund is $1,000,000, gross China exposure in the fund is 44%, and the fund’s total gross exposure is 266%. Would it make the most sense to say $1mm*2.66*.44 =$1.17mm would be the notional exposure to China? Or would I want to take gross China exposure as a *percent of total fund gross* and then apply that to invested capital to get an idea of the effective capital exposed (trying to take the leverage effect out) …like 44%/266%=16.5% and then $1mm*.165=$165k to say that, effectively, $165k of the equity invested is exposed to China once you “undo” the leverage?

1. In terms of net exposure: would I want to take net China exposure as a percent ent of fund NAV? Assume net China exposure is 30%. If my NAV is $1mm, does it make sense to say my net long exposure is $300k?

Another thing I don’t quite understand about all this is how could net exposure of invested capital be more than gross exposure?

2025-02-23 17:57:02,"We asked an AI to analyse which companies are most threatened by... AI itself - Here's what it found TL;DR: Our financial analyst AI analysed more than 2,000 public companies for AI disruption risk and it came out with some pretty interesting findings.

Hi all,

We all hear endlessly about how AI is going to revolutionise businesses globally, but it's rare to hear any real focus on which companies specifically are most likely to be disrupted and why.

As such, we recently used our AI analyst ([Primer](https://primerapp.com/)) to analyse more than 2,000 public companies and rank them by their vulnerability to AI disruption. Some fascinating patterns emerged that I thought would interest some of you.

Key findings include:

* Professional services giants like Cognizant and Accenture could see 50-75% of their business models challenged by AI (especially in code development and consulting)
* Traditional manufacturers surprisingly made the top 20 list - companies like Continental could see 40% of their business affected through AI-driven automotive tech disruption
* Media/content companies (WPP, Future) could see up to 65% of certain business units disrupted by AI content generation
* Financial firms show surprising vulnerability - banks and insurers could see their high-margin advisory work threatened by AI

We had[ Primer](https://primerapp.com/) analyse each company's divisions individually, looking at their reporting history and business models to generate disruption scores.

For full transparency - I work at Primer, and we're sharing this research to showcase our platform's capabilities. I would love to hear any feedback on the report or any other similar report types you would be keen to see.

2025-02-22 20:05:50,"Genuine Question Recently had a conversation with a small private fund manager and some things were brought up to me that I questioned. He went into full detail about the obvious troubles of starting a fund and finding investors etc. 

I have a few questions that I’m hoping some you all could maybe explain because this manager couldn’t explain them and I have no idea why he couldn’t. 

As many of you are aware there are legitimate day traders that trade from home or office and are successful. What I mean successful is that they are profitable and rake in 10% to even 150% returns year in year out. Yes 150%. Why wouldn’t an individual like this take their knowledge to start their own fund that would quite literally blow competitors out of the water. Think about the best funds in the world. Haidar or Millstreet with returns of 20% + on average returns. To me that’s quite honestly horrible. I mean I personally trade and have reruns far greater than 20%. So really why don’t successful traders start their own fund? What limitations are there? To start ll have licenses or credibility but those are easily attainable with years of hard work. 

Is it more complicated than this? Of course im fully aware but historically hedge funds are that heavy on returns so why hasn’t they’re been a pioneer that has started one using their own strategy that proves to be far greater than any of the others?

I asked the manager, well what are your returns and he had mentioned roughly 7 to 8% this past year. I said wow that seems low and he took offense. I then mentioned there are day traders that make far better returns per year and he went on to explain that their strategies couldn’t translate to management and real time trading with that amount of funds. But why not? I can trade your strategy from home so why can’t you trade mine? What limitations are there? You can trade however you’d like white whatever fund you have the last time I checked.",,reddit/hedgefund
2025-02-22 14:43:18,"What's the highest-T prop trading firm or Hedge Fund? I work for a sell side firm in a role which is somewhat a hybrid between a Quant role and low-latency QD / data infrastructure engineering role.

On paper I'm a Quant Researcher, but rather than studying complex mathematical models (something that would actually be interesting) I'm solving latency engineering problems in a system which already exists and was written by some quants who apparently didn't know much about how to write efficient software. I mainly do two things. Fix slow software by replacing slow algorithms with fast ones, or by optimizing the software so that it runs faster, or I fix infrastructural problems, such as replacing one type of database with another one to improve performance.

I'm fine with what I'm doing at the moment. It's an easy job since there's no one else in the company with the skills to do this role, or with the experience I have on the technical side. 

Essentially, my job is pretty secure. I'm gaining experience on the Quant side, which is filling out my CV nicely. I'm able to make reasonable progress fixing some latency/data engineering issues with relatively little effort, and everyone seems to be impressed by my performance so far despite the fact that I know I'm underperforming.

Unfortunatly, I'm bored. I should be making 10x the progress fixing these data latency issues, but I am being inhibited by multiple factors. The most significant issue is that the software devs are obstructive. Most of them work remote. They hide information from my team, because they're afraid of losing their jobs. They're all completely incompetent. The level of stupidity is just astounding. These guys just can't make a simple, straightforward engineering decision. I think they are just incapable, out of their depth, and don't know what they are doing. Most of these guys appear to have been hired through nepotism.

What I've realized is, most of the people on my team are actually not that capable either. Most of my team are pretty much pure-quant. They don't really care about software. To be honest, I think they find writing software to be an annoying but necessary part of the job, rather than being something they are either interested in or enthusiastic about.

I have worked for a large number of firms in a short period of time. The only good firm I worked for was a backoffice/accounting software firm. Everyone there was extremely capable. The best of the best. Most of the other roles I've held I either quit after a short period of time, realizing it wasn't a good fit for me (aka no career progress or the company wasn't doing what I was interested in), or I was axed due to departments cutting headcount.

I left the backoffice firm to join a hedge fund, and later regretted it. I was hired by the fund to build out the first version of their trading platform. I enjoyed the work a lot, but as soon as I had got enough stuff working for the founders, they terminated my position there. To be honest, those guys were assholes. Not team players. They either didn't recognize talent, or didn't care about retaining talent. A valuable lesson I learned there was that some hedge funds are not be particularly interested in building stable technology. The technology is more of a tickbox for the investors. This particular fund didn't even care if the technology worked or did anything sensible. As long as it gave the appearance of doing something useful that was considered enough to pull the wool over the investers eyes in order to take their money.

Basically the point of all of this is to express that I'm bored and pissed off. The only thing I can imagine myself enjoying is working in some high-T environment, likely a prop trading firm or another fund. I want something more than what I have now, which is a comfy but boring, relatively slow paced, but secure job. I'm paid pretty well, so I'm in no hurry to leave, but when I do leave I need to do something more interesting than this.",,reddit/hedgefund

With the SEC tightening cybersecurity regulations, there’s more pressure than ever to stay ahead.

But here’s the problem, many firms still rely on outdated security approaches, reacting after an incident happens rather than preventing it. 

That’s where a vCISO (Virtual Chief Information Security Officer) powered by AI can make a difference.

✔️ Catch threats before they become a crisis

✔️ Streamline compliance reporting so you’re not scrambling before an audit

✔️ Monitor security 24/7, so nothing slips through the cracks

I am an autodidact with interests in economics and Python. 

I have developed a portfolio strategy using some economic ideas I developed. Using Python I trained some models on 10-year slices of market data to make dynamic reallocations (no more than once per day), and tested the models on the rest of the dataset.

Here are the relevant metrics over the past 20 years from my backtest for the most interesting model:

  
Annualized Return: 32.45%

Annualized Volatility: 0.1399

Sharpe Ratio: 2.3204

Sortino Ratio: 3.0788

Calmar Ratio: 1.7689

Max Drawdown: -18.35%

Obviously, I understand that nobody will invest unless I have some sort of track record, so I have now started paper trading for 1 month (4 weeks). So far I have 1 actual investor: me! And so far the results were pretty consistent with the backtest: I am up 4.98% and the SPY is up 1.94%. Strategy is long only and only using deep and liquid markets (treasuries, SPY, QQQ, GLD) and without buying any stocks in individual companies. And before you ask, no, I am not running n different models and just selecting the best one by Sharpe/CAGR, lol.

1) How long do I need to run paper trading before anyone in the industry will take me seriously? Where do I take my results if the results remain consistently good over the coming months/years?

2) I don't have a job in the hedge fund industry, or even one connected to the wider financial industry. What sort of job roles would you recommend I look to apply for? I have a BSc in data science.

Am I right in thinking that investments, trading and hedge funds work to ensure that money on the stock market ends up being taken away from underperforming companies leaving them on sale to encourage change, and adding that money to companies with more potential to give them power to grow, in the same way that someone in upper management might scale down projects that aren't productive and assign more resources to teams and projects that are doing much better, for the company to be more effective?

I would expect that as a whole this system helps companies and industries be more effective for the world and improves the products and services they provide, and prevents ineffective companies from wasting people's time and money

These ‘Briefings’ contain **deep** ***reasoned*** **analysis** that factors in a company’s entire reporting history and **highlights crucial changes in guidance, tone, and outlook**, that human teams - without perfect memory and infinite time - typically miss.

Take a look at an example 'Briefing' [here](https://my.visme.co/v/mx0qmmgj-o7d0o7y#s1) as well as a couple of [videos](https://pitch.com/r/primer-feature-videos-wkyiaa) that will give you a better idea of how the platform works.

1. How much capital would it be recommended to have in order to start a hedge fund? Can you start a hedge fund with almost nothing, or do you need at least, let's say, 500k?

2. How lengthy is the registration process?

3. Dear fund managers and analysts, how do you find clients when you are at the very beginning? I find it quite hard to find clients when you are starting from scratch without having been previously working for a hedge fund / asset manager.

4. How stressful is the life of a fund manager?

5. How do you manage risk? What tools / software are you using for risk management?  

6. How does risk reporting to the clients work? How often are you making risk reports for clients (yearly, quarterly, monthly)? Did it happen that your clients asked for risk reports out of the blue?

7. Beyond strategies and elaborate thesis, what quantitative skills would be necessary? Is knowing Python(with Pandas and Numpy), R Studio, MATLAB, Java and C++ enough?

8. How complex is data management? For sure, it is complicated, taking into consideration cyber security concerns and large datasets, but I would love to read your opinions.

9. What are the most difficult aspects of clients and investors' management?

10. How are you dealing with complience and regulations?

11. For those bad days when you are losing money, how do you deal with it, and how do you get yourselves back on track?

12. How do I get the necessary equipment for trading? (Or from where can I buy). Like, those Bloomberg stations and keyboards, do you receive them upon buying a Bloomberg terminal subscription? Or is Bloomberg leasing them?

13. What's your opinion on activist investing? Is it worth it?

14. How do you find a good auditor? Do you trust Big 4 firms? 

For anyone who read until this point, thank you for your patience. I appreciate any kind of advice, and I'd love to hear your stories and learn from your experiences.

For example, usually if the value of assets leveraged declines, a variable margin rate would mean lenders can ratchet up the amount of margin required at the worst times, putting stress on the fund. Whereas a fixed rates would be more “stable.”

But my real question is if this is even a thing, or if margin requirements are always variable? Or always fixed? I just don’t know how it works is all.",,reddit/hedgefund

I, French M28, am currently working as a quant in a pod at a hedge fund (since Sept 24) in London. I would like to come back to France for good but I really like my job and don’t want to have to quit for that. My goal is to keep my job and work from France. The problem is, the company doesn’t have any office in France, so I don’t think they can move me to France with a French contract (I might be wrong). To me (assuming they agree to help me make the move because they don’t want to loose me), the only solutions are:
1. Make me a consultant with a French contract. I’m not a big fan of this because I would loose my company benefits and more importantly I don’t think I would be able to get my end of year bonus anymore (which can be quite substantial)
2. Keep me with my current UK contract and have me work from France but send me back to London on a regular basis. The frequency would be chosen so I comply with the minimum amount of time allowed outside of the UK. If what I say is true, I also don’t know what is that “minimum” here for the UK.

It borrows a further $300 as margin from its broker. With the $400 in cash, it wants to hold a market neutral portfolio, X long and X short. Typical margin rules for equity dictate that you can short around 50% of long equity kept as collateral. So cash funding for the X long, X short book should be X + 0.5X. Equating this to $400 suggests that a hedge fund could execute a market neutral book of GMV $533.3 while needing to pay interest on $300. If the fund can make the risk free rate on its GMV exposure, then its earnings should be (533.3 - 300)*risk free rate. Is this realistic? ",,reddit/hedgefund

Unlike traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where a single model retrieves documents to answer queries, our multi-agent system works collaboratively, sharing context and insights in real-time. For example, if the Technical Agent detects unusual price volatility, it flags the News Agent to identify related macro events, while the Industry Agent checks if it's sector-wide or company-specific. This dynamic interaction ensures deeper, actionable insights.  
Here are some example queries for the multi-agent system:

1. **""Why did \[Stock Ticker\] drop 8% today despite strong earnings?""**
2. **""Is \[Stock Ticker\]'s high P/E affected by some news?""**
3. **""Which sectors are most affected by rising interest rates?""**

  
Here are some example queries for the multi-agent system:You may see video and code in Python at Quantjourney at substack: [post](https://quantjourney.substack.com)

2. If not what kind of further degrees should I look into as now is the time to get to applying for grad school.

I recently received an interview invitation from a German company for a junior position, and I’m wondering how best to prepare. Here’s the process they outlined:

1. The first interview will be virtual and last about 60 minutes, including a mental arithmetic test and an IQ test.
2. The second interview will be in person at their office, lasting about 1.5 hours, where I’ll have the chance to discuss my trading experience and knowledge of options.

Since this is a German firm, are there any specific resources or websites that could help me prepare? I’m particularly looking for tips on improving my mental arithmetic and IQ test performance, as well as any cultural nuances to keep in mind when interviewing with a German hedge fund.

You are ""public""  and your performance is tracked.    One thing i can think off the top of my head is that you are not audited.  But a ""pro"" account basically looks very similar to a hedge fund.  You get fund documents, etc.  Its a UK audited FCA fund.    etc.  Raise your own money.  Costs are similar (maybe less), but more benefits in collecting revenue, etc.

Background about myself: 

I've been fascinated about finance since middle school, went through a bunch of rabbit holes, I invested into crypto, stocks w/o any knowledge, then got into trading CFDs, afterwards I heard about prop firms in 2020. I got mentored by a person who works in at a bank during 2020, collected data, became ""profitable"" trading. I got funded during HS using CFD prop firms, I got payouts, every payout 50% went into futures account just in case, met a few good traders and told me what to data to collect so I backtested again. This year I got booted off from the prop firm because I'm American and using CFDs is would be an issue to the prop firm, then I hopped on my futures account, since I had a solid back testing data and ""live"" data records (CFDs) I risked 5% per trade on my futures account, it went well, but then I wanted to learn how to start a HF, I did research, studied for licenses (failed), so during cooldown I realized risking 5% per trade and showing it to a client wouldn't be attractive. Then I back tested again properly which is the data im currently talking about, stressed tested my strategy it didn't do well (worst case was -18%). I do have to redo my futures track record and thinking of getting audited after 2 years of trading. I also do have in mind what prime broker to use once I get myself rolling.

I have not spread the risk around like is typically advised. I have only allocate large percentages to companies that have ended being ranked towards the top of the market in performance.

I have a concentrated, aggressive portfolio that uses a lot of long term options contracts.

I try to only invest in a select few areas I have a asymmetrical level of knowledge in my favor compared to the rest of the investors in the market.

I decided a few months ago to try to tackle this problem with a friend of mine (both of us have CS backgrounds) and we created something that is now solving that quite well for us.  We made a tool that takes your excel modeling template and can fill in all the static input cells with financials from the filings that you upload to the platform using AI.  The AI understands your excel sheet via an excel add-in to know what to fill in and where, and then searches through the filings you uploaded to extract the numbers into each cell within just a few seconds.  The best part is that there's a way for you to verify where each cell result came from because we built an auditing pdf viewer experience that lets you see exactly where the number was found highlighted in text from the filing for any cell.

Doctly wasn’t originally meant to be a PDF-to-Markdown parser—we started by trying to feed complex PDFs into AI systems. One of the first natural steps in many AI workflows is converting PDFs to either markdown or JSON. However, after testing all the available solutions (both proprietary and open-source), we realized none could handle the task without producing tons of errors, especially with complex PDFs and scanned documents. So, we decided to tackle this problem ourselves and built Doctly. While our parser isn’t perfect, it far outpaces most others and excels at parsing text, tables, figures, and charts from PDFs with high precision.

While no solution is perfect, Doctly is leagues ahead of the competition when it comes to precision. Our AI-driven parser excels at extracting text, tables, figures, and charts from even the most challenging PDFs. Doctly’s intelligent routing automatically selects the ideal model for each page, whether it’s simple text or a complex multi-column layout, ensuring high accuracy with every document.

With our API and Python SDK, it’s incredibly easy to integrate Doctly into your workflow. And as a thank-you for checking us out, we’re offering free credits so you can experience the difference for yourself.

Sharpe is 1.004  
The largest Drawdown was -29.55% taking roughly 3 months to recover.

2024-10-07 04:36:10,"101/2 Lessons by Paul Marshall - Pragmatic approach to hedge fund management *101/2 Lessons from Experience* is written by Paul Marshall, co-founder of the highly successful hedge fund Marshall Wace, which has an investment model that combines fundamental and systematic equity long/short strategies. I find many of his ideas not only insightful but especially relevant to hedge fund management today. I wanted to capture some of my thoughts on his perspectives—both for my own reference and to share with my readers.

1. Who Really Believes in Market Efficiency

The author is very clear on his stance, but what caught my attention was that I've encountered numerous critiques of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), but few approach it from this perspective. He used the Mandelbrot’s theory of stock prices having memory and George Soros’ reflexivity theory to explain his point.

* Reflection: Behavioral economics and complexity economics present strong arguments challenging the market efficiency axioms of the Chicago School. Human behavior introduces complexity and non-linearity to markets that can't be fully captured by rigid axiomatic thinking. While the failure of many fund managers to consistently beat the market is often used as an argument in favor of market efficiency, it could also be viewed as a function of human behavior—where biases and cognitive limitations play a key role in underperformance. As a market participant, I have seen reflexivity work way too many times to ignore it. I would also highly recommend Mandelbrot’s book ‘Misbehavior of Markets’ to understand more about his work. While markets have been inefficient from time to time, I still feel that market structure changes all the time and hence it gets more and more difficult to beat markets and for most of us, passive investing might be the way.

1. Humans as Market Participants and Their Biases

Human behavior, both at the individual and collective levels, often deviates from rationality. Various behavioral biases influence investor decisions, complicating the concept of market efficiency. Paul Marshall highlights a few biases, of which I have highlighted four which I have found the most relevant based on my investing experience.

* Optimism Bias: This bias drives investors to overestimate positive outcomes and is a primary bias of momentum traders.
* Gambler’s Fallacy / Mean Reversion Bias: This bias leads investors to expect that asset prices will revert to their historical mean, encouraging a value-driven perspective.
   * Reflection: In my own investment approach, I try to combine both - while optimism bias is my default basis especially in constructive markets, I am always trying to counterbalance this by identifying pivots in market structure or individual stocks where mean reversion might occur where stock prices have deviated significantly from their intrinsic value, anticipating a reversal. If executed well, this blend of optimism and value-driven thinking can enable consistent market outperformance.
* Anchoring Bias: Fund managers often become anchored to what has worked for them in the past, showing resistance to evolving as market dynamics shift.
   * Reflection: Flexibility is essential in a constantly changing market landscape. Clinging to past successes can hinder adaptation and prevent investors from seizing new opportunities. Being mindful of this bias helps me avoid stagnation and keeps my strategies fresh. Since I invest on cross-asset basis, showing the flexibility to change allocation mix between bonds and equities been a key area of work to prevent anchoring bias.
* Disposition Bias: This bias causes investors to sell winners too early and hold onto losing positions for too long. It’s a widespread challenge, even among the best investors.
   * Reflection: This is one of the toughest biases to overcome. Warren Buffett's success lies not only in his ability to pick winners but also in his discipline to hold them as they continue to compound intrinsic value. He effectively ""hacked"" this bias by investing in companies that exhibit long-term growth, allowing him to ride their success without the temptation to sell prematurely. This is a bias I struggle with the most.

1. Concentrate and the Diversify

The author thinks about investing from a perspective of return for a unit of risk. Hence Information ratio (for long only managers) and Sharpe ratio (for hedge fund managers) are critical to understand the skill behind a fund manager. The author rightly points out that the best way to generate the highest risk adjusted returns is to ‘Concentrate around best ideas and then diversify to reduce risk’. Concentration increases returns and diversification reduces risk thus improving risk adjusted returns. Diversification, when used well (either at individual Portfolio manager level, or at the institutional level for a form hiring a bunch of PMs) can be a potent tool to increase risk adjusted returns and improve Sharpe ratios.

* Reflection: This lesson has a huge appeal to me as I am personally not comfortable with highly concentrated portfolios. I have gravitated to diversification while managing best ideas through slightly larger sizing. I generally concentrate in 10-15 ideas and then layer 15-20 ideas over it either as toe-holds or mid-sized positions. It allows me to sleep well and gives ideas that can move into the core group.

1. Long Term Thinking v/s Short Term Trades

Many of us are familiar with Benjamin Graham’s famous quote: “In the short term, the market is a voting machine; in the long run, it’s a weighing machine.” This thinking is often echoed by value managers who focus on long-term fundamentals. However, Paul Marshall provides a crucial insight: both short-term thinking and long-term patience have their place in investing. Multi-strategy funds like Marshall Wace effectively combine these approaches with their quant businesses leveraging short-term market movements to capture alpha while the discretionary fundamental PMs can take a longer-term view.

* Refection: Duration of trades is an important tool to create alpha. This resonates with my own approach to portfolio construction—being mindful of the duration of trades and diversifying that duration to achieve an optimal mix. This framework helps capture alpha while enhancing consistency over time. While as an individual trader, one does not have the quantitative resources, but it can be replicated by constructing some trades that are capturing more short term moves, while layering them with long-term thematic bets.

1. Seek change and go for ideas when they are half glimpsed and half understood

The author is a proponent of catalyst-based investing. Interestingly, he critiques the idea of holding high-quality companies long term, considering it an inherently lazy approach, especially in today’s markets. He argues that the competitive advantage periods for companies have become increasingly unpredictable due to rapid technological disruption and intensifying competition. This is particularly true when the cost of capital is low, making it harder to rely on long-term holding strategies without accounting for these shifts.

* Reflection: I call it pivot points in the market or in a stock. I'm constantly on the lookout for these moments of inflection. Identifying pivot points can be done using either technical tools or a fundamental approach. The latter tends to be more powerful, but when combined with technical analysis, it can lead to substantial profits.

1. Shorting stocks need a different approach and framework for success

The author presents a compelling narrative on shorts, emphasizing both the difficulty in generating alpha on the short side—particularly after accounting for costs—and the characteristics of a good short position.

* Reflection: In my view, timing is critical when it comes to shorting. Shorts are most effective when targeting companies in industries that are undergoing structural challenges or distress. Identifying these moments of vulnerability can greatly increase the chances of success on the short side.

1. Machines are Coming - If you can’t win, join them!

One of the major debates in the markets today is whether quant funds will replace fundamental investors. While quant funds excel at capturing factor-driven alpha, they can struggle during market regime shifts. On the other hand, fundamental investors can leverage data to make more informed decisions.

* Reflections: I've experienced the market regime argument firsthand through my investments in one of the Renaissance quant funds, which struggled to generate returns and significantly underperformed the market coming out of the COVID crisis. I am a big believer in passive investing for retail investors. As quant funds continue to dominate factor-driven strategies and institutional fundamental investors increasingly harness data to enhance their analysis and insights, it will become increasingly difficult for retail investors to gain a competitive edge.

1. Risk Management - Understand both Quantifiable and Non-Quantifiable Risks

The multi-agent, nonlinear complexity of markets makes understanding and mitigating risks a critical component of long-term success. The author moves beyond the Bayesian approach of quantifying risks, focusing instead on those that cannot be measured, what he calls emergent risks. He underscores the importance of viewing leverage and liquidity as essential tools for managing these unpredictable risks.

* Reflections: While simple in theory, many risk managers fall into the trap of obsessing over quantifiable risks, neglecting the role of human agency and reflexivity. As a result, black swan events occur with far greater frequency than normal distribution models predict. The insight of applying the uncertainty principle to risk management—identifying and contextualizing emergent risks—is, for me, the most valuable takeaway of the book. To this day, liquidity remains a key variable for me in my portfolio construction framework.

In conclusion, this is a short book with some deep ideas. It might not be a book for individual traders or investors (might be tough to appreciate it) - more relevant for PMs or analysts at hedge funds aspiring to be portfolio managers. I would give it a solid 4/5 as a finance book.",,reddit/hedgefund

A lot of new AI based products are being introduced in the professional services industry, like Harvey in Legal, Hebbia in finance. Curious what is the general opinion of the folks here on these products. Did anyone try these out?

  
I am actively building in this space and looking for the general sentiment of folks who are open to try out new products in this category. I feel there is too much noise right now, with everyone trying to sell a solution (including me sometime back).

I have worked extensively with LLMs/AI before and I know firsthand that they are still not able to do accurate calculations or miss out on specific details during analysis. But, they still have a huge potential to change the manual workflows. Like going through hundreds of PDFs/documents to extract information, performing scenario analysis, etc.

I tried for a bit and was frustrated by not having the same tools that the big boys have like Bloomberg, CapIQ, Refinitiv, etc.  Since then my co-founder and I got to work since we have backgrounds in CS and over a few months built [filot.ai](http://filot.ai) which uses AI to understand your unique financial modeling template and can then extract the key financials from filings (i.e. 10k, 10q, press release) and fill them into exactly the cells they should go. It works really well and saves us and some initial funds a ton of time.  One request I've gotten a lot that we recently added that I'm loving is the ability to have an audit trail for every AI data extraction into excel cells, so that you can see for every cell highlighted in the text exactly where the data came from.

\`

Please take a moment to review my pitch deck, and I’d appreciate any feedback you may have!

\`

[Avinash | Instagram | Linktree](https://linktr.ee/SQ_Capital)

\`

EDIT - Answers to the questions raised in the comments. Thank you all for your valuable suggestions!  
\`  
AUM & Trading Approach:

The AUM for the returns I mentioned is $30M, and these returns are from live trading—not backtesting, as I don't believe backtested results are reliable or accurate to share.

\`

Metrics:

The Sharpe ratio for the strategy is 0.37. If you're interested in more specific metrics, I'd be happy to share them with you directly.

\`

Trading Style & Edge:

I primarily use speculative trading based on a combination of fundamentals and technical analysis. The edge I bring comes from partnering with over 20 solo traders and fund managers, allowing me to diversify risk and enhance returns through collaboration.

\`

Proving Strategy:

All returns are published on Myfxbook and are linked to a live account. I understand the importance of demonstrating the validity of these strategies, and I'm open to suggestions.

\`

Investment Minimums:

The $100k for individuals and $1M for institutions is meant to reflect different levels of engagement, but I acknowledge that my pitch deck needs refinement. It’s currently a work in progress, and I’m looking for guidance on how to polish it for better clarity and presentation.

\`

Service Structure:

At this stage, I’m offering managed account services, but the goal is to transition into a full fund over time. The fee structure is currently 30% for us and 70% for investors, and this will likely evolve as the fund grows.

\`

Experience & Team:

While I’ve only started raising funds this year after spending last year completing my learning, I have been sharing all my trades this year with investors and firms to build a solid track record. The combined experience of the team is over 40 years, with the most experienced individual having more than 10 years in the market.

\`

Regarding SQ:

As for the name ""SQ,"" it doesn’t refer to the futures term. It’s just a name I chose, and there’s no specific relation to market terminology.

\`

Combined P&L: 

The P&L is $30M, and all of my contact information, including links to Instagram, Twitter, and email, can be found on my Linktree. This makes it easy for anyone to reach out directly.",,reddit/hedgefund

2. Maintaining models for quarterly updates - manually updating the financials when earnings come out.

2024-08-21 01:57:56,"Anyone interested in joining a hedge fund incubator program? 

What’s going on hedge fund fam.

My name is Ryan. I’m 38 from Los Angeles.

I’ve been working on this idea for a while which came to me after I was mentored by a CTA. I met this individual purely by serendipity. He was a commodity broker for 20 years with experience running CTAs, CPOs and introducing brokers.

I had traded options and futures for over 10 years before meeting him. He helped me get my Series 3 and Series 30, also registered me with the NFA with two of his CTAs.

I learned SO much from this guy and the disparity between retail and institutional is staggering. There is no replacement for hands on real world experience from guys who have raised and managed millions. Not only from a structure and compliance view but also picking strategies to build trading programs around.

Typically the barrier to entry is very steep cause most hedge funds and CTAs do not train managers or CTAs, they hire phds and quants to do the heavy lifting on salary and bonuses but not sharing in the management fees or performance fees which are only available to CTAs and principal partners.

I’m in the process of creating a hedge fund/CTA incubator platform where I will teach all of this and help you get licensed, as well as fund and launch hedge funds and CTAs with qualified students. Of course you can launch your own fund and do it whatever way you want but I truly believe in the power of community and education.

The biggest set backs I see from my personal experience in this industry are understanding really how the business and compliance side works, and then of course the trading and capital raising itself. You can also fail really easy if you try to move too fast, if you manage to set everything up correctly and then lose client money it can really set you back.

I originally started this to find qualified people to become brokers and raise capital for my funds. This is a business where collaboration and uniting brilliant minds is where the magic really happens. So I wanted to create something that could facilitate this aspect of the business independently from the funds themselves.

After thinking about it and having numerous discussions with CTAs and brokers, this idea and the way I’m setting this up can have a much bigger footprint and impact than I originally thought.

One of the biggest barriers to entry is obviously capital, most traders right now rely on prop firms which really is only good for short term solutions as you can’t scale, and you’re extremely limited on applicable strategies, you also can’t retain a management fee.

There are several loop holes that allow you to manage capital for clients without any licenses or heavy compliance when you start, this is something we will utilize inside the incubator.

The great thing about this industry is you don’t even need to be a great trader to make a lot of money, you could strictly raise capital, or start a fund of funds where you allocate capital to existing CTA/CPO programs which are already profitable with experienced managers.

As an example, one of the CTAs my mentor knows is a young kid, he’s like 29 now, he started his CTA with 5m from friends and family, in 3 years doing mediocre returns, he has grown to 227m AUM. He makes about 400k a month in management fees and he made his clients north of 20m in the first quarter of this year, while making close to 4m in performance fees for that first quarter.

The scale and possibilities of this industry are truly limitless. I also believe in the power of community and education as there are some things I have learned that wouldn’t be possible without great mentorship.

If this is something you’re interested in, maybe you have criticisms or suggestions, shoot me a DM, would love to talk.

This community will be a place where all people, ideas and thoughts are given a chance to be heard.

Cheers!",,reddit/hedgefund

I’m currently a strategy consultant who is looking to eventually break into the world of hedge fund. I need your advice / input on how to get there.

I have a bachelor’s degree in business but with the concentration in finance. I went from management consulting and then strategy consulting. 

I did a bit of research and most of hedge fund only recruits mathematicians etc from top universities like Princeton, MIT etc, or those with IB / ER experience, or MBA at H/S/W.

I’m thinking about pursuing masters but my YOE is only about 3 years so it probably wont make sense to aim for MBA at H/S/W (however I’m at quite prestigious firm so H/S/W after 5 YOE is doable. But again, post-MBA careers are heavily impacted by pre-MBA so I don’t think I have good chance going that route given it’ll be 5YOE consulting without any finance work experience). 
Instead I’m thinking about MFin at e.g. U Chicago or equivalent and maybe go into IB, OR do MFE at NYU or Columbia or something like that. 

What path do you think I should take for me to reach my career goal? I know for sure that consulting is not for me, and I never considered it as my life long career. And to be honest, the fact that I don’t enjoy it make it very miserable for me.

Recognizing I was ""ready"" I decided to start formalizing a track record a bit more than a year ago. I opened a corporate account with IBKR and funded it with $140k of my own capital.

My returns have been extremely strong, yet volatile. In 2023 I returned 157% (July through December) and this year I'm currently at about a 40% return. My strategy is discretionary, repeatable, and scales.

I also have a lot of relationships with investors, but they are in the real estate world. I put together my tear sheet and short marketing deck and have started circulating it to some folks I'm closer with to gain feedback (and potentially soft commitments).

I've also had a couple conversations with the folks at Repool about fund setup and administration.

Here's where I'm struggling... fundraising!

Yes, it's early and I've only just started talking with folks but the reception has not been strong. Mostly, I believe I'm talking with the wrong folks. These are real estate people that generally don't trust the stock market. They are also smaller mom and pop type investors.

I know I will need at least $2MM - $3MM in commitments to justify spinning up the fund and I'm recognizing it will likely be a GRIND getting there. 

So I'm asking myself whether it makes sense to pursue that route or, perhaps, go the non-professional advisor route with IBKR. The logic here would be that I could take my time onboarding people individually. Then, once we get too big for that, or the fund size justifies it, I could transition to a full-fledged fund.

The other route is just grinding soft commitments to get me to the $2MM - $3MM point and hoping most are still wanting to commit when it comes time.

Any thoughts or advice from folks that have been there and done this would be much appreciated.

Thank you!",,reddit/hedgefund

My query is: say I am bullish on Gold. As per my trading system, my target is $3000- $3500 in the coming months or few years.

How will HFs play this move, will they simply buy futures or keep selling puts for additional ROI, etc?

2024-07-15 18:42:34,"CALLING ALL HEALTHCARE ANALYSTS, have you seen anything like this before? Share your thoughts below So I'm an investor in Indivior (INDV) - a small cap healthcare that's looks undervalued on a number of metrics and on sellside estimates.

Their main drug is Sublocade which came to market in 2017 and has grow very well. It's a long-acting-injectable for treating Opioid Use Disorder and has benefitted from the Opioid crisis in the US. It's active ingredient is buprenorphine which is an Opioid agonist and binds to Opioid receptors in the brain.

This drug competes with the daily oral and sublingual medications of buprenorphine which is what c95% of patients take vs c5% take Sublocade because it has to be administered once monthly unlike oral medication you take at home. Indivior has a generic oral on the market aswell called Suboxone. These treatments are for withdrawal symptoms and somewhat protects against overdose but isnt a real time solution if someone is overdosing. Narcan which is fast acting nasal or injection used for emergency overdose in real time. Indivior have a version for this called Opvee (nasal spray).

Anyway the company recently released an update stating there were discontinuing a schizophrenia mediation called Perseris (small % sales). They also lowered guidance for the year on the key drug sublocade, for a number of reasons including low customer stocking and removal of medicaid auto enrolment. Really the focus on this company revolves around the Sublocade growth story.

Market hated this and the share price fell around 30% on the update. The delta was about $100m less total group sales as revenue grow for FY24 as fell from 18% YoY to now about 8%. A key reason why the market didn't like it was because Camurus and Braeburn have a competing drug that was approved last year for the US market called Brixadi (sold in EU under Buvidal) which is arguably the same drug as Sublocade with a few different features.

So the market took this as ""management are seeing competiton now"" instead of reasons above - low customer stocking and no more medicaid auto enrolment. I think Management have been pressed by analysts on each earnings call since brixadi got approved in 2023 regarding pricing pressure or market share movements.

Now here's what I'm really interested in. A law firm is investigating and trying to find investor platifs who lost money from the announcement. Based on potential securities fraud ????? 

Link here - bgandg.com/indv/ 

I've never seen something like this, as this happen Oaktree Capital more than doubled their stake immediately after the selloff and are now the second largest shareholder. 

Why is a law firm investigating, isnt that the SECs job?

Did an investor approach the law firm first?

Does the law firm actually have evidence of securities fraud or something thay suggest management have defrauded investors?

Or did they notice something that could be fishy and post the investigation on their website hoping to find both platifs and evidence amongst investors that show investors were defrauded??

Never seen anything like this. The law firm also has won big settlements in the past but also if you go through their website they are ""investigating"" many small cap US equities.

Class actions and investigations link: 

bgandg.com/cases/ 

Has anyone seen anything like this before, personally the business looks undervalued and I think the concerns over the competitor aren't as severe as the market thinks for reasons I won't go into here. 

Are there any investment professionals that want to share their thoughts?

If gross exposure = |long|+|short| and most long-short funds are net long, if the market declines, I would think overall your longs will have a greater negative impact on the portfolio than your shorts would have a positive impact.

2024-06-28 23:17:39,"What steps to become a hedgefund manager? I know that this question has been asked here before. I feel that my focus is unique, so I hope you don't mind the repetition.

My background:

Age: 27

I'm getting my Bachelor's in economics now and will graduate next year. My GPA is 4.0. I spent my twenties running various educational programs as I've traveled the world, while also working with quite a few NGOs. I speak four languages (English, Spanish,  Portuguese, Russian) and could learn any others, given the incentive. 

Up until now, I've been trying to change the world as much as I could. But the harsh truth is this: money moves the world. The only way to really fix problems is to have the resources to do so. So I want to make money.

That motivation may sound dystopian, idealistic, or (somehow) both. But that's a bit of an aside from what I'd like to ask you all. I have a unique experience with the political and social elements of countries around the world - especially countries that Westerners tend to avoid. I believe that I could use that experience to predict conflicts, elections, coups, and major policy changes. My fund's niche would be investing in the companies, currencies, and real estate most likely to be affected by global events. 

Admittedly, I don't know any more than what Google has told me about getting a hedge fund job. So that's what I'm here to ask. 
- What internships should I be applying to? (E.g. Wealth Management, Global Investment, etc.)
- Would a CFA, Master's in Economics, MBA, or more languages be the most valuable education to pursue afterwards?
- How can I meet hedge fund managers or specialists who know about my niche?
- What's the best job to start out with? Financial Analyst? Financial Advisor?
- What else do I need to know?

In depositions, Bill Disomma, a co-founder of Jump Trading, and Kanav Kanya, the head of Jump Trading Crypto both assiduously pled the fifth amendment for every question beyond their address. And it’s not hard to see why – their behavior with regard to Do Kwon and TFL was shady, if not criminal.

Since they were not being charged, it seems like the SEC was trying to use their non-prosecution as leverage to make the group’s top officers cough up records, emails in particular, which they provided and which were later unsealed.

Do Kwon came to them in 2019 and made an offer of a variation of the deal the future Prime Minister Spajić was offered, but much, much sweeter.

2024-06-05 06:10:32,"My Thoughts On This SubReddit I just stumbled onto the hedge fund topic sub here a few hours ago and spent that time going through many of the discussions. I have easily noticed some recurring things that I had some of my own thoughts toward and would like to put them out there (I hope that's okay with you all). My intention is merely to open up a conversation about these points and spark some impactful discussions regarding it all. I like to think posting this can truly bring some good insights out of it.

**Everyone is (pretty much) in the same boat**

First off, it is evident we can or have all beat the returns of the market index. However, it definitely seems like we are all in a similar catch-22 about starting an HF, being that we have a strategy we confidently believe in but have zero prospects of attracting high-wealth investors to partner with. I assume most of us are finding ourselves in despair about it too.

**There is lots of inconsistency about what the startup costs actually are**

Not only just here in this sub, but also all over Google, have I seen so much variation with what the compliance, registration, and regulatory costs are to be able to launch the fund. I have seen these expenses noted to be anywhere from $5k-$75k. These costs are essentially just coming from the act of filing paperwork with government authorities. From my experience with gov't charges, these filing fees will be the same across the board for the same types of entities. I get that the attorney expenses will be different, but not so much that everyone has wildly different expectations. I should mention that I believe we should be concerned with the *minimum cost* to get the fund active... In the business world we call this a minimum viable product. The additional costs like hiring a team of people are not even relevant here because we don't *need* them in order to start. Am I the only one who wants to get to the bottom of what the accurate figure is for taking the low-budget approach to doing these requirements? Is there anyone here who has already done this and can give us an accurate number? Furthermore, is no one else considering the possibility of negotiating the startup fees being covered equally between all partners involved? These investors are going to dish out $1M to get into the fund... I am sure an extra $5k each is not going to be a problem. 

**Many of us the people in this sub are overvaluing spending a few more years to get a track record**

Why are most people under the impression that an extra 4 years of managing a \[relatively\] valueless portfolio or incubator (yes... even $100k AUM is really *nothing* to the Mega-Millionaire target partners) is going to actually increase the odds of attracting investors? This is completely negligible to them. You're better off walking into their office tomorrow with nothing to show for and giving them a sales pitch they can't refuse. After all, filthy rich old dudes love a good business proposition that is delivered with passion, confidence, and knowledge. You will at least have their attention enough to carry on the conversation. AND you just saved yourself from wasting years of your life in vain. I think we should dive off the deep end sooner rather than later, chase our dream immediately, and just see what comes of it. 

**Finally... what's up with all the pessimism and cynicism going around in these threads?**

We are all in the subreddit for the same reason, with the same questions, and same hang-ups. How about we all be respectful and friendly with each other so we can work together to make our dreams come to life? These negative and plain rude comments at each other are uncalled for and are extremely counterproductive.",,reddit/hedgefund

2024-05-26 00:40:46,"Want to start a fund if I keep up performance. Any advice? I want to start a hedge fund in 4 years if I can continue beating the S&P 500. The issue is my account is not the largest (5 figures), as I contribute 15% of my paycheck to the account. 

I have been investing in the market since 14 years old. My first ever investment was a 6 bagger. Turning $4k from mowing lawns into $24k. Investing in a natural gas company prior to the fracking boom. This got me hooked. I haven’t been able to consistently invest because I have largely been a broke 20 something and always had to use money for LIFE. But when I have invested, it’s usually been a winner. 

My approach is simple and nothing novel. But my eye is tuned. I keep a very concentrated portfolio of no more than 5 stocks at any given time. I say NO to a lot of opportunities as they do not fall within my competence circle. I seek quality businesses with moats, in industries that I understand the WHY of a customer purchasing,  large growth prospects for the future, and at decent enough prices. Largely inspired by Charlie Munger and Mohnish Pabrai. 

Even when I was flat broke I read 10Ks for fun. Im known amongst friends and family as someone knowledgeable in investing. Which has granted me the opportunity to manage a portion of one of my father’s 6 figure IRA accounts. This account is doing well but not beating the market. I could have beat the market, but when we started it 2 years ago he was eager to invest the funds. So I chose investments right before an overall market decline. The account started at 400k pre decline and sit in the 450k range as of today. 

Im 32 years old today. I really feel this is my calling. If you were to ask those in my community what my calling is they would concur. As my advice has turned profitable since my teens. 

I’ve avoided my calling, and can’t stand the thought of avoiding it into the future. 

I want to start a hedge fund in 4 years if my performance stays consistent. I currently work a blue collar trade job which sustains me until then. 

How can I best prepare myself to attract capital to start a fund in 4 years? Is there any other general advice you may have?

I am currently at the fork on the road of two very different career options. I have a background in data science, and recently, risk management in capital markets. I got an offer from a large data  company to sell capital market data as an SDR. $100k base + commission (still in the works to layout the detail of the commission structure). 

  
The second option, I am interviewing for a Hedgefund for a Compliance Assistant role that is offering base $110-120k, up to $130k with bonus. 

I understand the first option is unique because, this company isn't as well known as the parent company, and they have very valuable data that every bank, portfolio manager will need to do their trading. So I can see, myself selling the product really well, but I never done sales before and I am wondering if I will hate the sales cycle and outreach. 



The second option seems like a nice safe career, and growth. Not the biggest pay right away but lots of room for growth over the years. Since it is a junior level role, it's a good place for me to get acquainted with the work and become a SME. The fact that it's a hedgefund, also looks good on resume for future options.

Let's dive into an opportunity that's opening up the world of hedge funds to a wider audience - and it's something that could potentially redefine passive income for ambitious investors.

**Enter the World of Hedge Fund Rentals**

What if I told you that there's a way to access the strategic might and financial leverage of a hedge fund without needing millions in capital? This isn't about buying into a fund with a hefty minimum investment. It's about ""renting"" the capabilities of a hedge fund, tailored to work for you.

**The QuantumCode Initiative**

QuantumCode is pioneering this groundbreaking approach. We've developed a platform that allows individual investors to tap into the prowess of hedge fund strategies, algorithms, and market maneuvering, all through a service that integrates seamlessly with your existing investment activities.

* **Accessibility**: This platform opens up hedge fund strategies to those who previously could only dream of such financial firepower.
* **Scalability**: Whether you're looking to enhance your existing portfolio or start anew, the platform scales with your ambitions.
* **100% Passive**: By leveraging advanced algorithms and strategic market insights, you're positioned to generate value in any market condition.

**Community-Centric Testing Phase**

We're in the final stages of beta testing and are inviting the Reddit community for an exclusive early look. Your feedback could help shape the future of retail investing.

**Join the Movement**

2 investors into the fund:

Investor A: $100k  
Investors B: $100k

End of year 1:

Investor 1: 80k (20k unrealized loss)  
Investor 2: 80k (20 unrealized loss)  
NEW Investor 3: 80k

In year 2, only one trade was made, for a short term profit of 15k, unrealized loss recovered a bit, so that A and B are only down 10k on that portion.

End of year 2:

Investor 1: 95k (10k unrealized loss, 5k realized gain)  
Investor 2: 95k (10k unrealized loss, 5k realized gain)  
Investor 3: 95k  (10k unrealized gains, 5k realized gain)

I would assume, in this scenario, that each person should pay taxes on the 5k of realized gains. Right?

Wouldn't that be the correct way?

Unfortunately it is wrong, and Investor 3 gets stuck with > 5k of gains because of equalizing disparities or something. I do not understand why there are any complications to the above.

It's kimbo\_m8 and I'm stoked to share something that could seriously up your trading game. Imagine having the firepower of a hedge fund, right from your laptop. That's what we're talking about with QuantumCode's latest automated hedge-fund technology.

**What's the Big Deal?** We're not just talking about another trading platform. This is advanced, integrated technology designed for serious traders, blending seamlessly with WordPress. It's powered by QuantumCode's sophisticated algorithms. To put it into perspective, our QC index (a dynamic mix of strategies) transformed 10k USDT into 240k since February 2023 – and it didn’t even break a sweat during global upheavals like the pandemic. 

**Why you should get us to know?** With us, you’re adopting methodologies that have been refined and proven over years. It’s about leveraging a system tested with millions of dollars and designed to cover all market conditions profitably.

Now, here's where it gets really interesting for you guys. We're about to go live, but before we do, we're in the final stages of testing with our community members. And I thought, who better to invite for an exclusive early look than the Reddit community?

I'd love for you guys to be among the first to try this out and see what you think. We’ve set up a Discord, and I think you're really going to like what you see. Here’s the link to join us: [https://discord.gg/ZtFC9az5a3](https://discord.gg/ZtFC9az5a3)

""I recently read an [article](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ivps-new-fund-shows-growth-investors-are-ready-to-get-off-sidelines) in The Information that spoke about a certain growth stage venture fund raising a new billion dollar plus fund, how it had beaten the S&P500 by several times in the last decade, and that its 2015 vehicle returned a 27% IRR as of 2023, putting in the second highest quartile, while its DPI (distributed to paid-in) was 1.8x, putting it in the top decile of funds for that vintage.

2024-02-08 20:09:04,"Ken Griffin: The Maverick Investor Changing the Game (complete on my substack)  

Ken Griffin was desperate for a satellite dish, but unlike most 18-year-olds, he wasn’t looking to get an unlimited selection of TV channels. It was the fall of 1987, and the **Harvard College** sophomore urgently needed up-to-the-minute stock quotes.

Why? Along with studying economics, he happened to be running an investment fund out of his third-floor dorm room in the ivy-covered turn of-the-century Cabot House. Therein lay a problem. Harvard forbids students from operating their own businesses on campus, but he still got the authorization and this was the start of a great story.

Griffin was born on October 15, 1968 in the state of Florida, in Daytona Beach County. As a teenager, during his time at Boca Raton Community High School, he served as president of the math club. This particular trait would define the way he made his fortune.

His interest in the market dates to 1986, when a negative Forbes magazine story on Home Shopping Network, the mass seller of inexpensive baubles, piqued his interest and inspired him to buy some put options.

Miffed at the size of the broker’s fees, he ambled over to the Harvard Business School library and read up on finance theory. He soon built his own convertible bond pricing mode.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0oruhpkp4fhc1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c14a976294d429ff8464d829ef2759ccaff65f1

 

Returning home to Florida during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years, Griffin visited a broker friend working at the **First National Bank** of Palm Beach and began to discuss his new model. A retiree named Saul Golkin walked into the office and listened in as Griffin explained his theories about trading converts.

After 20 minutes, Golkin said, “I’ve got to run to lunch. I’m in for 50.” At first Griffin didn’t understand. Then the broker explained that Golkin had just agreed to invest $50,000 !

Emboldened, Griffin quickly raised a $265,000 limited partnership **( that’s worth about $682,000 today when adjusted for inflation )**— whose investors included his grandmother — called **Convertible Hedge Fund #1**

With the $265,000 dollars he managed in his fund, he managed to benefit from the **Black Monday of 1987**, which allowed him to deliver profits to those who trusted in his talent and, in addition, to start managing a second fund.

In 1989 he graduated from college with a degree in economics and a reputation that attracted the attention of a famous manager of the time, Frank C. Meyer, founder of Glenwood Capital, who decided to test Griffin’s expertise by giving him a million dollars to manage.

In response, Ken Griffin far exceeded expectations by delivering a **70% return** within a year. This feat earned him the interest of several firms to back him and provide capital for him to manage and grow.

 

### Citadel LLC: building an empire

As a result of this great first year return, Griffin founded **Citadel LLC** on November 1, 1990, in the Illinois city of Chicago, with an initial capital of $4.2 million, and is today one of the largest hedge funds in the world.

At first, Citadel traded only U.S. convertibles, Japanese convertibles and warrants — lucrative trading arenas in the early 1990s.

>“In the early 1990s, if you knew how to model a bond, you could make a lot of money,” says convertible bond chief David Bunning, a onetime Harvard wrestler who joined Citadel as its sixth employee in 1991. Griffin hired inexperienced college graduates and even interns as he gradually expanded.  
**“It was a global arbitrage shop run by a 22-year-old,”** says Bunning.

Griffin’s youth showed. Former employees recall that he was forever challenging Citadel traders to defend every nuance of their positions and personally running them through pointed grillings at regular trading meetings

**“From day one, the goal was always to build the best independent trading firm,”** says Griffin. ***“If you make $100 million at another hedge fund, you are a god. If you make $100 million here and someone down the street makes $400 million, you’d better be thinking about why you didn’t make $500 million.”***

Such competitiveness is not uncommon in the hedge fund world, but what sets Griffin apart, and just might secure his reputation, is an absolute mania for management. Though a first-class trader himself, he walked away from the convertibles desk years ago to dedicate himself totally to building the business and creating an institution with a solid infrastructure.

That’s something investors like Julian Robertson and George Soros tried to do too late Griffin has done this by hiring talented executives and instilling in his troops his obsession with systems and analysis.

Unusual for hedge funds, he has brought in professional managers from places like **Andersen and Boston Consulting Group**. He built an internal stock lending operation in the late 1990s to allow Citadel to fly below Wall Street’s radar.

By 1994, Citadel had expanded to **60 traders and analysts**. However, the bond market witnessed a historic decline that year, causing several hedge fund closures across the board. In a panic, Citadel’s clients withdrew about a third of their capital, resulting in a 4.3% decline for the fund. That marked Citadel’s first down year.

2024-01-28 16:23:27,"HedgeFund Manger Hello All,

&#x200B;

Love to answer questions about getting started with hedge funds. It seems after scrolling through the thread most are more interested in creating one than investing in one.

&#x200B;

(Background) I created my fund awhile back. Was always in the space. My closes friends were Hedgefund managers. I also had an above average track record for years on my personal portfolio. One of the funds tried to hire me on and instead ending up helping me create my own cause we were close friends.

(Fund) Total return, long term capital gains equity fund. That means I dont do anything that causes short term tax for investors. Standard 2/20 fee structure. All fundamental investing. I do not diversify at all. One to three stock at any given time is more than enough.

(Creating the fund) Structuring the businesses was interesting. I did it all on my own with help of other managers and lawyers. This means PPM, Subdues, fund type there are two main type for equity (506B and 506C) as well as tax preparations.

(Information) I use interactive brokers. Fund admin is Nav consulting. Lots of questions on here about fund admins there are only a few Nav is the most well known. Very small piece to the puzzle but its important.

&#x200B;

(Lastly for those who are wanting to create a fund without getting absolutely milked by a law firm for setting one up in the future I will sell a package and advise people how to go about creating one and walk them through the process. With help you can get one built sub 50k. Going though a lawyer your looking at 250k alone for the PPM of quality and Buiness structure will be another 100k plus. Ive gone down both roads it’s about 500k all said and done working with a law firm. They are trash in my opinion and take advantage of the fact nobody actually knows how to lunch a hedge fund but a select few so they try and sell there advisor as something magical. Will experience if your intelligent and motivated and do it yourself mostly it takes about 4 months to launch a fund.

I want to pivot into buyside, more interested in doing investment research (like fundamentals) than trading. 

I have been working at a big name CIB as a strategy consultant (think what MBB will do: strategy planning, process improvements, etc.), so there's no deal experience, no equity research work, no due diligence work involved.

I have heard pivoting into buyside depends HIGHLY on your pre-MBA work experience and it is almost impossible to get an offer without IBD, ER, or other buyside experience on your resume.

I'm 25 (will be 28 to start a FT job if I go to Wharton), F (idk if that makes it harder in this industry), and need sponsorship (5 years remaining on H1B, heard it's hard for buyside to sponsor).

I got a pretty generous fellowship from Wharton (not a full ride), so I won't need to take out any loans, but it will most definitely deplete all my savings.

I'm also hesitant to ""aim lower"" and go into IBD. My current company is flexible with internal mobility and I have the opportunity to join an IBD coverage team in 2024 if I don't go to MBA in the same year. However, IBD isn't strong at my current company (even though the company itself is well-known), so I'm worried that without the MBA platform, it would be difficult to go from there to buyside in 2025 even if I'll have 1yr IBD experience.

Personally, I'm leaning towards going to Wharton bc my undergrad is a T30, not that competitive in a sea of ivy undergrads. But I want to be more objective with my decision. Should I take the chance and go to Wharton? If so, what should I start studying for / preparing for the recruiting season? There's CFA level 1 exam in Feb, would taking that help? 

Sorry for the long post. Any insights from current MBA students with the same goal or anyone at buyside would be highly appreciated!! Thank you so much!",,reddit/hedgefund

To make a long story short, I grew up in Haiti and was able to get my undergraduate degree in BBA at Emory University, which already puts me well ahead of almost all of my peers from Haiti. 

Now, I am trying to take it to the next level and shooting for the moon (even if I end up landing somewhere on the clouds). 

I spent the last 6 years doing IT Audit - The Audit of IT Infrastructure and Information Systems. 

This past year, I applied to business school with a 710 on the GMAT and got in Wharton Lauder but ultimately passed on it due to the program costing 230k (I know some of you guys will grill me for not going). After re-applying to business school, I am landing with a full ride at U. Chicago Booth. It seems that HE are lathered with H/S/W post-MBA candidates, so I am trying to carefully craft my plan between January and September to start building a foundation for HE and stand out amongst the competition. 

Here is what I came up with and that is where any advice or help would be so helpful:

1. Work a finance internship in a Financial institution in Haiti from January to the summer 2024 (smaller IB market). 
2. Find an IB Pre-MBA internship over the summer with a US based bank.
3. Recruit for IB/PE Middle Market Firms in Chicago/IM firms.
4. Get my FMVA (Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst) certificate for IB and PE recruiting
5. Clear Level 1 CFA before school starts for IM.
6. Finish my CFA within the next 3 years

After doing research, I could also work on a masters degree in Finance/Data Science/Computational Science from Harvard or purpose a PhD in Economics or Statistics part-time at whatever institution I can get in. 

I know my life is going to be hell for the next 10 years or so, which I am ready to embrace. I just want to know if it even makes sense or are there fundamental things that I am missing.

Mathematics. Smart people. Artificial intelligence. Algorithms. Nobody can invest in it. Mystery. Almost magic. All very vague. But it all sounds very cool.    


The question is: how?    


It's not a conspiracy, sincere and respectful question.    


Could it be fake? A Ponzi?    


I want to read your opinion.    


My doubts are:   


1. They don't have a negative return. For example, every time the SP500 was negative the Medallion Fund's return was positive by much more. Sometimes x2 or x3. It can happen in the financial world but that it always happens seems strange to me. (Leverage x5,x10?)  

2. Renaissance Technologies' public funds are as good as any, with ups and downs. Instead the ""secret"" one, the Medallion Fund, always positive return.  

3. Mystery. Employees can't talk about how they make money. The money is managed internally without having external inputs. Warren Buffett is transparent about everything. For better or for worse, you find his companies where invest, you know his investment philosophy, his mistakes and his victories. Here you find only victories.  

4. The financial media constantly praises him but no one has ever questioned him. All speeches and questions are ""fantastic team"", ""mathematics"", ""quantum strategy"". Very generic.

I am currently in the structuring phase of a crypto hedge fund idea that is quite intricate in the way it operates. I wouldn't like to reveal much as I think the idea is quite novel. To get to the point, I would like to create a fund that accepts any amount from investors and passively invest it for them within 10 cryptocurrencies through various ratios of their investment. The fund will initiate as a passive fund with leeway to become actively managed. The way that investment from clients work is what is novel. I have looked at multiple jurisdictions with a low barrier of entry in terms of a legal framework and regulations such as the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Malta, Estonia, Switzerland and Dubai. In terms of fund structures, I also looked at approved funds, incubator funds, investment partnerships but I can't seem to find the right structure that works perfectly as most  have either a minimum amount to be invested or a maximum amount of investors.

Hey everyone at /r/hedgefund,

Diving headfirst into the AI rabbit hole here and I’m super curious about how it's shaking things up in the hedge fund and wealth management world. We all know tech’s changing the game fast, and AI’s right there leading the charge.

I'm really keen to hear how you guys are using (or planning to use) AI to make things tick better. Whether it's about smarter risk management, next-level trading algorithms, or just making clients happier with some AI magic, I'm all ears.

Here’s a quick rundown to get the ball rolling:

1. **Risk Management:** How's AI helping you spot the sneaky risks traditional methods miss?
2. **Algorithmic Trading:** Anyone using AI to predict markets and make smarter trades?
3. **Client Relationships:** Any cool AI tools making your clients feel like VIPs?

Basically, I'm fishing for any nuggets of wisdom or cool stories you’ve got on AI in our field. What’s working for you? Hit any bumps along the way? Think AI's going to be a game-changer soon?

I am asking because I am starting a business on helping the finance sector implement AI in their industry. I'm also aiming to connect with any hedge fund managers who are really interested in adding AI agents to their websites or marketing channels (like facebook, instagram, and youtube). I want to know what you pain points are so I can best use AI tools to help you out.",,reddit/hedgefund

1.  Put $1M into SP500 and let it sit there for the next 20 years
2. Put $1M into my hedge fund for the next 20 years and it outperforms sp500 by 5 points each year

Based on my calculations, it is possible for the investor is WORSE OFF by investing in a hedge fund that outperforms sp500 given the fact that investor would have to pay taxes on the fund's gains right away.  Whereas, in option #1, investor can compound without taxes during those 20 years.

2023-10-23 07:58:30,"Difference Between Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds Hedge funds and Mutual funds are both investment vehicles, but they differ a lot in many ways, like strategies, policies, regulations, and investor types. Here we will see the differences in detail.

**1. Structure:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are mainly structured as private investment firms. They are not as regulated when compared with mutual funds; in fact, this gives hedge fund managers more freedom in terms of their investment strategies and the asset classes they invest in.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are regulated investment companies; they are typically structured as open-end investment companies. They are heavily regulated by the Securities Board.

**2. Investment strategy:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds employ a wide range of investment strategies and techniques like long and short positions, leverage, derivatives, and other investments. They aim to make high positive returns regardless of market situations, and they have the flexibility to short-sell assets to profit from falling prices.

Mutual Fund: Mutual funds are designed for retail investors, and they follow traditional investment strategies like buying and holding stocks, bonds, and other securities.

**3. Liquidity:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds often have more restrictive liquidity terms. Investors have limited opportunities to withdraw their funds, such as withdrawing their investments only at a specified time, such as lock-up periods or notice periods for redemptions.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are generally more liquid. Investors can redeem their shares even daily at the Net Asset Value (NAV) price.

**4. Fees:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds charge both management fees and performance fees. Management fees are charged for the assets under management (AUM), and performance fees are a percentage of the profits generated. These fees can be very high.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds charge management fees, but they are low compared to hedge funds, and they also do not charge performance fees.

**5. Regulations:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are less regulated compared to mutual funds. They have more freedom compared to mutual funds but carry a higher risk.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are heavily regulated by the Securities Board and must adhere to strict investment guidelines and reporting. The regulations are there to protect the investments of retail investors.

**6. Investor Eligibility:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are open only to accredited investors and institutional investors, like someone with an investor profile or high-net-worth individuals, pension funds, and endowment funds. They have high minimum investment requirements.

Mutual Funds: Mutual Funds are designed for retail investors and are accessible to a wide range of individuals. They have minimum investments and are open to the general public.

**7. Transparency:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are less transparent regarding their holdings and strategies. Investors may not have real-time visibility into their fund’s positions.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are also not transparent, but when compared to hedge funds, they are a lot more transparent; they disclose their holdings and strategies to investors.

**8. Risk Profile:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are riskier investments as they use leverage and alternative risky strategies. They aim to make high profits but also carry higher risks.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are known as low-risk investments, suitable for investors with a more conservative risk tolerance.

Hedge funds and mutual funds differ significantly. Hedge funds are designed for more sophisticated investors seeking higher returns, which come with high risks. On the other hand, mutual funds are designed for the general public and are more straightforward investments with lower minimum investment requirements ",,reddit/hedgefund

2025-04-10 13:50:55,"Expected Days to Market Bottom Image: [Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-8-36-27-AM.png](https://postimg.cc/Jy5RP0Q1)

tl;dr: We are likely within a few short months from market bottom if not already there. 

The top graph shows RUT (Russell Small Cap 2000), which has been a reliable indicator of where we have been in terms of days to market bottom for the last 35 years. 

For the top graph (RUT), the y-axis is the log(price) which is required to get the trend line functions to work properly - not useful other than getting the script to work. Each trend line is a standard deviation from the log-linear mean (center black line). The vertical red lines are the transition from one standard deviation below the mean to the next market bottom. The SPY is the graph below which shows how it correlates to RUT pricing and market bottoms. I added the days to market bottom as a bar chart and, as shown, only the two major recessions hit >100 days. With the current price of RUT we are 14 days into the count.  

The main point is that when this index is below one standard deviation from the mean (bottom gray line) it's a good buying opportunity - and - shows that we are likely not far from a market bottom regardless of the situation. What I consider to be the ""short-term pain"" rhetoric.

Considering the extreme overvaluations during the 2000 market top and the havoc that occurred during the financial debacle during the end of the 2000s, the max time from the bottom was around 180 days (6 months) based on this analysis. 

That being said, the market is forward looking so if we hit 2 standard deviations below the mean, which has been close to occurring in all four recessions, then expect the economy to feel pain with unemployment rising for a an additional year (economic recovery lags market bottoms).

2025-04-10 13:45:37,"Archer Aviation (ACHR) is Looking Like a Solid Bet 🌟✈️ So, Archer Aviation has been making some waves lately, and there are plenty of positive signs.
First off, let’s talk about today’s action—ACHR saw a nice 3% bump in its stock price, which is always a good sign. It traded as high as $7.28 before closing at $6.86. Not bad at all for a company that’s still in growth mode. The volume was a bit lighter than usual (about 9.7 million shares vs. an average of 19.9 million), but that doesn’t necessarily mean anything negative—sometimes it just means investors are holding tight and waiting for the next big move.

Now, here’s where things get even more interesting. Analyst upgrades are pouring in for Archer, with Cantor Fitzgerald raising their price target to $13.00, up from $10.00, and issuing an """"overweight"""" rating. That’s not the only upgrade; other firms like Canaccord Genuity and Needham have followed suit, bumping their price targets to around $13.00 and $13.50. Even Deutsche Bank joined the party, lifting their target to $15.00. Overall, analysts seem pretty bullish with a """"Moderate Buy"""" consensus rating and a price target of $11.61. That’s a solid upside potential from where it’s trading right now.

On the financial side, Archer is looking healthy, with a low debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.16, meaning they aren’t over-leveraged. The company also reported better-than-expected earnings last quarter, posting an EPS of -$0.30 when analysts were expecting -$0.40. Small wins like that go a long way in building investor confidence.

There’s also been some institutional interest. Big institutions jumping in is often a sign that the stock has long-term potential. Plus, insiders are still holding onto a good chunk of shares, with 9.75% ownership—so they have skin in the game, too.

Of course, like any stock, ACHR isn't without risk, but with strong analyst support, solid financials, and increasing institutional backing, it seems to be moving in the right direction. Keep an eye on this one—it could be a solid play as the electric aviation space takes off. ",,reddit/investing

>Slumping energy prices helped keep inflation tame, as a 6.3% decline in gasoline prices helped drive a 2.4% broader decline in the energy index. Food prices climbed 0.4% on the month. Egg prices rose another 5.9% and were up 60.4% from a year ago.

>Moreover, shelter prices, among the most stubborn components of inflation, increased just 0.2% in March and were up 4% on a 12-month basis. Used vehicle prices were off 0.7% while new vehicle costs increased just 0.1%, ahead of tariffs that are expected to hit the auto industry hard.

5% BND/BNDX

49% VTI

34% VXUS

7% VEU

5% VIGAX

But recent events have made me rethink my strategy, slightly.

Essentially, I don't feel super confident in tech or the entire US market in general due to P/E ratios and the chaotic nature of everything right now. I am interested in diversifying a percentage from VTI and invest into a US ETF that is more focused on blue chip stocks.

As far as my international exposure, I am interested in diversifying a percentage of that into an ETF that is invested in international holdings that might be shielded from some of the volatility of US markets.

Technically this will not be a 3 fund portfolio, something more like a 5 fund portfolio, but essentially following the advice of John Bogle's strategy and using Vanguard (I also have 2-3 years of cash on the side between HYSA, Money Market.. about 10% of what's invested in the market) For someone in my position, what could I look into?

Do not try to stop a falling knive ' Great Depression 3.0 incoming, we're all screwed.

Phase/ Incident 3. Someone comes out who claims to have inside information that Trump is planning to pause the tariffs for 90 days. And there are talks with most countries so chances are they won't even happen anymore. Things are looking up again, people start getting hope, markets look to recover. 
Trump comes out ' the rumous are not true. There will be no pause. Tariffs are mEDiciNE ' People freak out and sell, Trump's friends are buying harder than ever. Stock price swings back and forth as a result.

Aside from that I have my Roth TSP with work, a pretty immature whole life insurance policy/account (still not sure about this), and savings in an HYSA that I'm using to save for a house. 

My son's dad and I are separated, and he started a 529 account for our kiddo in early 2023. He's contributed 12k and it's at about 25k. Our son is almost 14. I would trust my money with him if I were to add to the existing one, though truly my preference is to keep our finances separate. But I want to do what is best.

My question is, is it worth it for me to start a 529 for him right now as well - is that the best way to start saving for him on my end at this time? And how much would I need to contribute right away for it to have a chance of being somewhat successful by the time he would go to college given I'm starting so late (I know time is the true key, but here we are)?

I believe it's correct that if he finds an alternative way to pay for college or does not go to college in some form, if we let the money sit in the 529s for 15 years, our son could then roll it into his Roth IRA which would be pretty cool for him I think...

Before U.S. market opens tomorrow, I expect China will increase tariff on U.S. goods to 125%. There are some reports that China is evaluating a stimulus package, but that is uncertain yet.

  
In the next 90 days, we will see U.S. negotiates with all other countries and regions, tries to block China from a new world trade organization, and tries to implement a worldwide tariff on China goods. During this process, U.S. may take other measures including banning transhipment, delisting China stocks or ADRs, cutting off more technologies, pausing interest payments, or confiscating China assets. Those could be threats or could be implemented. China is likely to impose tariff on U.S. service revenues. There is a small chance that the trade war will escalate into a real war: China side believes its navy is getting close to the U.S. level and can protect its oil import, while U.S. side believes its navy is far superior. Well, most Americans don't know U.S. no longer has strong shipbuilding or repairing capability, which is why Trump is so eager to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.

China already sold $50B two days ago, and it needs a place to spend its USD. With weakness in worldwide currencies, one plausible approach is buy physical gold and silvers.

So, I'd like to tell the brokerage to place a GTC limit sell order for X shares at $Y.  I understand what this is and how to do it.  However, I would also like there to be something of a stop-loss order on *those particular shares* should they go up past a certain price but not quite make it to the limit price.   Can this be done without babysitting the limit sell order and placing a GTC stop-loss after it goes past the lower amount?  I prefer to set it and forget it...if it never goes above the stop-loss limit (and therefore the limit sell, either), I am fine to hang onto those shares.  If this can be done and is a known strategy, what is the name for it?

Example

Own 1000 shares of $200 stock.  Wanting to sell off 200 shares at a minimum of $210 but would like to try for $220 and will settle for $210 on the way back down if it doesn't make it there.

If it matters, brokerage is Fidelity.  No need to advise on any tax issues...I'm just seeing if this even a possibility and if it has a name.  I'm going to call my rep tomorrow but was hoping to have a little better understanding before I do and was further hoping someone here can point me in the right direction.

Should I invest a portion of this in the stock market now?

1. My parents are paying for my tuition, but not my housing, so I still need to keep enough money to be able to pay for rent, groceries, gas, etc. I am looking at around 10k in rent expenses per year.
2. I am currently still working, making $21 an hour and working 15-25 hours per week.
3. I am planning to buy a car from my parents for 9k so I will have to take that into consideration when deciding how much to invest.
4. My ultimate goal is to invest this money for around 10 years in order to grow it for a down payment on a house.

2025-04-09 19:17:30,"🎭 ""Tariff Theater"": Why the 7% Rally Is a Mirage, Not a Market Rebound The recent 7% rally in equities, coinciding with the Trump administration’s decision to roll back certain tariffs to 10%, has been interpreted by some as the beginning of a broader policy shift. In reality, the fundamental landscape remains unchanged. If anything, the superficial nature of the rollback only highlights the extent to which markets have latched onto optics in the absence of substantive improvement. This rally in equities has not been mirrored by the bond market.

The core dynamics of U.S. trade remain adversarial. China, the United States' largest goods supplier, continues to face high and sustained tariff exposure. The aggregate effective rate, factoring in prior rounds of reciprocal escalation, remains above 100% in several key categories. The European Union has not softened its stance, and in many areas, has reinforced its commitment to retaliatory measures. These are not temporary frictions; they are structural conflicts driven by divergent regulatory philosophies and increasingly protectionist trade regimes.

The administration’s trade team has pointed to limited agreements with smaller economies as signs of progress. But these are largely symbolic, wins on paper that have little bearing on global supply chains or multinational corporate strategy. For firms with cross-border exposure, especially in manufacturing, technology, and retail, the operating environment remains materially constrained. Cost structures have not normalized, logistics remain fragile, and geopolitical uncertainty continues to inhibit capital deployment.

Multinational firms, Apple being a key example, have not seen operational relief. Their upstream suppliers are still entangled in the broader tariff gridlock, and downstream demand remains vulnerable to price transmission effects. Margins are thinning, and strategic flexibility is diminishing as firms are forced to hedge against policy volatility rather than invest into expansion.

Beneath the surface, core macroeconomic indicators point to a deteriorating environment. Unemployment, while still moderate by historical standards, is trending upward. Real wage growth has stalled. Inflation, particularly in services and shelter, remains persistently elevated, even as headline CPI shows deceleration. Consumer credit delinquencies are rising. These are not the foundations of a sustainable recovery.

The current rally in equities is not being underwritten by earnings strength. On the contrary, forward guidance across several sectors has been revised downward, and earnings compression is visible in both nominal and real terms. What we are seeing in markets is not confidence, it is positioning. With liquidity abundant and volatility elevated, capital is rotating into risk on technicals, not fundamentals.

To complicate matters further, market behavior is beginning to resemble that of the late 1980s. Volatility is no longer episodic, it is persistent. The Federal Reserve’s posture remains hawkish, and the long end of the yield curve continues to rise, undermining equity valuations and tightening financial conditions in the real economy. At the same time, geopolitical dislocation is contributing to a growing perception that U.S. assets, once the global default for safe and productive capital, are no longer as insulated as they once were.

Foreign capital inflows are beginning to waver, and the strength of the dollar, long a source of stability, is now a headwind for export competitiveness. In this context, the idea that a marginal tariff adjustment constitutes a policy breakthrough is difficult to justify. If anything, it highlights how thin the narrative support for this rally truly is.

Until there is a credible de-escalation of trade tensions with China and the EU, a normalization of inflation and labor market conditions, and a return to earnings-led equity performance, the market remains structurally fragile. The recent rally is not a signal of recovery. It is a speculative drift, driven by hope, not data.

His theory is that the market will continue to get worse. And that even if it bounces back, S&P growth will hardly keep up with inflation over the next decade.

Up until now, I’ve been consistently dollar-cost averaging into the S&P 500 each month, which has been going well. Normally, I’d continue with that strategy since I’m still far from retirement.

About two years ago, my wife and I were fortunate enough to purchase a multi-family home in Queens, NY with an interest rate in the mid-4% range. Given the recent market volatility—and what seems like more uncertainty ahead—I’m considering two possible changes to our current plan:

**Option A:** Lower our monthly investment into the market and redirect that money toward extra mortgage payments.  
**Option B:** Lower our monthly investment and move that money into our high-yield savings account (HYSA), then make a larger lump-sum payment toward the mortgage at the end of the year.

While on the phone with Chase I explained everything and they then told me that I can open a ROTH IRA with Chase and how it will be easier because I already have an account with them. Does anyone know if one is better than the other or if one is more limiting? I don't now too much about investing and stocks but I do know that I should start putting money into a ROTH IRA for future purposes.,,reddit/investing

I’ve got an old 401(k) from a previous job just sitting there doing nothing, and I’ve been thinking about rolling it over into an IRA where I have more control. Not just for gold specifically, but maybe a self-directed setup where I can also invest in other alternative assets.

The problem is: there are a million options and I don’t know who actually offers the best IRA accounts for rollover. I’m mostly looking for low fees, good customer service, and flexibility. Some of these “best of” lists feel like paid placements and not real advice.

If you’ve done a rollover lately, which provider did you choose and why? Any horror stories or things you wish you knew before you started? I’d rather take my time and do it right than rush into something that ends up being hard to manage or full of hidden fees.",,reddit/investing

Looking back, the first trade war began late 2018, the market tanked for 2-3 months while Trump and China added more and more tariffs, and then the market started ripping back once some peace was found. I dont think theres any question the reports coming out from investment companies saying we're headed for a recession are true, if nothing changes I completely agree with that. I also think Trump, China, Canada and Mexico, and the EU all know that is the path we're all on and I dont think ANY of them truly want that. 

We're now 2 months into all of this, if I'm right deals will probably start coming end of this month or sometime next month and the market will rip back just on some sort of hope for once.

I'm 21, I know very little about investing or the stock market, and have never invested before, but from everything I've seen and read over the past couple days or weeks, now seems to be a pretty good time to invest into some stocks while everything is at a lower price then what it was before

I have about 1-2k that I could invest which yeah people might laugh at that cause maybe its not a lot but its just what I have and what I can do, and I would be ok with investing it knowing that the stocks potentially go even lower, knowing eventually it will hopefully recover but I figure might as well do it now instead of waiting trying to time the market and losing out on the ""sale"". I figure I could buy a bit of Apple, NVidia, Meta, Google stuff like that that's generally pretty safe but is on sale, am I right about that, or the S&P500.

So a couple questions I have:

1. What platform or app should I use to buy stocks, is robinhood good? Some of my friends use it, if not what to use

2. Lets say I have 2k to invest should I do it separately over 2 weeks, or over 2 months, or $500 a week, or all at once?

3. Is there any measure I need to take when buying a stock, do I just buy it and its there in the platform until the day I take it out?

4. Best things to invest in, or from your experiance best thing to invest in? As I mentioned above those are kind of the stocks I figure id try and get a couple of

5. Any other general advice you can give id appreciate, again not trying to do to much or go all in on stocks but I figured again I have some extra money id rather invest while the market is down then just have it be sitting doing nothing

Hong KongCNN — 

China unveiled retaliatory tariffs of 84% on imports of US goods on Wednesday, further inflaming a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.

The announcement means China has increased its intended levy on US imports by another 50 percentage points from the initial amount that was set to take effect on Thursday, matching the additional charge that US President Donald Trump has already imposed on Chinese goods.

Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs took effect earlier on Wednesday. China was the hardest-hit nation with a levy of at least 104% on all its goods.

There are many reasons to sell now, because odds of us approaching into a bear market is immensely high. People say, “buy more”. Yes, of course. But some people do not have cash on hand. Only when they sell, would they get the necessary liquidity buy at the market’s lows.

A simple strategy can be, liquidate most of your stocks, set a time horizon of when you think the bear market will end (6 months, 1 year, 2 years, etc.), then DCA back into the stock market based on this horizon.

2025-04-09 06:48:50,"Forget ceteris paribus, the world is not ending. When the market dips, the headlines scream ""Recession."" But are we actually in one? Or is this just another case of conflating stock prices with the real economy?

Lately, a wave of panic has hit financial media over the reintroduction of tariffs by the U.S. administration. Critics are framing this as a reckless economic move destined to collapse global trade. But here’s the thing: these tariffs were not a surprise. They were telegraphed throughout the campaign, reaffirmed after the election, and framed as part of a broader strategy to bring supply chains home.

So why the market panic?
Because investors love rhetoric, but fear action. Tough talk is tolerable—it creates volatility without consequences. But when that talk turns into policy, it forces a repricing of risk. Tariffs raise input costs, threaten corporate margins, and rattle assumptions built on decades of globalization. But that doesn’t automatically mean we’re heading into a recession.

In fact, this time might be different.

While tariffs are inefficient in the short term (yes, prices rise, demand dips, and you get some economic drag), they are also a lever—one used to reset the table. In response to this policy shift, the U.S. is experiencing a surge of domestic investment. Billions are flowing into new infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and energy production. Supply chains are being rebuilt. Semiconductors, electric vehicles, even steel—these industries are seeing real capital commitments.

That’s not recessionary. That’s reindustrialization.

GDP is about production, not vibes. And with that much money moving into physical investment, it’s difficult to imagine back-to-back quarters of contraction. Markets may be jittery, but the real economy is gaining muscle.

There’s also a philosophical point here. For decades, Western economies have relied almost exclusively on demand-side policy. Stimulus checks. Interest rate tweaks. QE. Meanwhile, the productive base hollowed out. Resilience was sacrificed for short-term efficiency.

These tariffs, crude as they may be, are part of a supply-side reawakening. They’re not about punishment—they’re about leverage. They force the conversation about what should be made at home, what should be traded fairly, and what national independence actually costs.

And yes, some industries will always make sense to import—coffee, for example, or products where climate or culture gives another country a permanent edge. But that doesn’t mean the U.S. or UK can’t adapt. Advanced societies with deep capital markets, engineering talent, and a strong rule of law have no excuse not to compete where it matters.

So no—tariffs aren’t some satanic invention. They’re a tool, like any other. Used poorly, they can be destructive. But used strategically, they can be the first step toward something more resilient.

It’s time we stop confusing the stock market with the economy. And it’s time we stop dismissing every deviation from the status quo as economic suicide. Sometimes, the short-term pain is exactly what long-term strength requires.",,reddit/investing

Crude oil has a price floor because the producers all have a breakeven price that if it goes under, they all start losing money so they reduce output and bring their price back up.

2025-04-09 02:34:46,"In-Depth Analysis of EHang: Why I Believe the Future of Low-Altitude Economy Lies Here?—A First-Person Perspective from an Analyst: Moat, Financial Inflection Points, and Valuation Expectations I also posted this DD in another sub.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CattyInvestors/comments/1juurkb/indepth\_analysis\_of\_ehang\_why\_i\_believe\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CattyInvestors/comments/1juurkb/indepth_analysis_of_ehang_why_i_believe_the/)

I. **Business Advantages**: Why Are the Three Moats in My Eyes Difficult to Shake?

As an analyst tracking the eVTOL track, I have always believed that EHang's moat has not been fully priced by the market. The following is the core logic supporting my judgment:

1.**Resonance between Demand and Policy**: The ""Favorable Timing and Location"" of the Low-altitude Economy

●**Market Size Estimation**: I have observed that the global eVTOL market is expanding at an annualized rate of 45% (from $35 billion in 2025 to $300 billion in 2030), and the policy support in the Chinese market far exceeds expectations. In 2024, the ""Government Work Report"" listed the low-altitude economy as a ""new growth engine"" for the first time, and subsidy policies in local governments such as Guangzhou and Hefei (with a maximum subsidy of 30 million yuan per project) have entered the practical operation stage. This pattern of dual-wheel drive by policy and market leads me to define 2025 as the ""first year of commercialization of the low-altitude economy.""

●**EHang's Positioning Advantage**: While its peers are still struggling with airworthiness certification, EHang has already obtained four major certificates: TC, PC, AC, and OC. This means that while its competitors' products are still being debugged in the laboratory, EHang's EH216-S can already charge for passenger transport in the pilot areas of Hefei and Shenzhen. This time difference brings at least a 2-3 year exclusive period, which is sufficient to capture early high-profit scenarios (such as scenic area sightseeing and high-end commuting).

2.**Technological Iteration**: Breaking through the ""Life and Death Line"" of Endurance and Cost

●**The data of solid-state batteries surprised me**: In November 2024, the EH216-S equipped with the battery from the Hefei Research Institute had an endurance of 48 minutes (a 60% increase compared to the original model), and the test team privately revealed that the target of the third-generation battery to be mass-produced in 2025 is directly 60 minutes. This means that a single flight can cover the straight-line distance from Shanghai Pudong to Hongqiao (37 kilometers), which may open up the imagination space of Urban Air Mobility (UAM).

●**The evidence of cost reduction in the supply chain**: The motor jointly developed with Zhuhai Enpower is expected to reduce the cost of the power system by 20%. In my research, I found that the unit cost of EHang in 2024 has dropped from 1.8 million yuan to 1.55 million yuan. With the commissioning of the automated production line (the second phase of the Yunfu base), the cost is expected to be reduced to below 1.4 million yuan in 2025, which is crucial for the overall gross profit margin to return to 65%.

3.**Production Capacity and Orders**: From ""Telling Stories"" to ""Real Delivery""

●**The delivery data refutes the doubters**: EHang delivered 78 aircraft in Q4 2024 (a year-on-year increase of 239%), and the annual delivery of 216 aircraft far exceeded the market's initial expectation of 150 aircraft at the beginning of the year. More importantly, the order structure has shifted from government pilot projects to commercial customers. Xiangyuan Culture and Tourism signed a contract for 200 aircraft at one time for scenic area operation, and the sightseeing projects in multiple cities have generated stable cash flow.

●**The production capacity layout reveals ambition**: I have visited the Yunfu base on the spot, and the debugging progress of its automated assembly line is one month faster than expected. After the production capacity of 1,000 aircraft is realized in 2025, with the regional coverage of the Hefei/Weihai bases, EHang is fully capable of increasing the delivery volume to 3,000 aircraft within 2 years, which will be 3 times the current market consensus.

II. **Financial Verification**: Why Do I Think the Profit Inflection Point Has Arrived?

Facing the financial report data, the market is always torn about the ""GAAP loss"", but my model shows that the non-GAAP profit is the real signal:

**Revenue Explosion**: eVTOL Has Transformed from a ""PPT"" to a ""Money Printer""

●In the company's revenue of 456 million yuan in 2024, Q4 accounted for 36% (164 million yuan), verifying the effect of production capacity ramping up. According to the current delivery rhythm, I estimate that the revenue in Q1 2025 will exceed 200 million yuan (a month-on-month increase of 22%). The annual guidance of 900 million yuan is on the conservative side. And now that the OC certificate has been approved as scheduled, it shows that the revenue from operation services is feasible. Assuming that the annual revenue per aircraft is 2 million yuan, if it can cover 3,000 scenic areas (5 aircraft per scenic area), the potential scale of operation revenue is about 30 billion yuan, which will open up the second growth curve.

2. **The Mystery of Gross Profit Margin**: Short-term Pain, Long-term Brightness

●Many people are worried about the decline of the gross profit margin from 64.1% to 61.4%, but when I disassembled the cost structure, I found that the one-time investment in the airworthiness modification of EH216-S has pushed up the unit cost, and this factor will be eliminated in Q2 2025. More importantly, the gross profit margin of operation services can be as high as 75% (only 58% for hardware). As the proportion of service revenue increases from 5% to 20%, the overall gross profit margin may return to over 65% by the end of 2025.

3. **Cash Generation Ability**: An Underestimated Survival Chip

●EHang's operating cash flow has been positive for 5 consecutive quarters, and the cash on hand of 1.155 billion yuan is sufficient to cover 3 years of R&D investment. Compared with Joby Aviation, which burns money at an astonishing speed (an annual loss of $400 million), EHang's ""self-cash generation"" ability makes me think highly of its risk resistance.

III. **Valuation Divergence**: Where Exactly Is the Market Wrong?

Currently, EHang's market value corresponds to a PS of only 15 times in 2025, while that of its peer Joby is as high as 69 times. This huge disparity puzzled me until I discovered two major cognitive differences:

1.**The Market Underestimates China's Policy Execution Ability**

Overseas investors have difficulty understanding the promotion speed of the ""Chinese low-altitude economy"". Shenzhen has built the world's first city-level low-altitude dispatching system, and Hefei plans to lay out 500 takeoff and landing points in 2025. The implementation of these infrastructure projects will directly increase the utilization rate of eVTOL, while their counterparts in Europe and the United States are still arguing with the FAA about the regulatory framework.

2.**The Revenue from Operation Services Has Not Been Priced**

The current valuation only reflects hardware sales, but EHang is piloting a ""profit-sharing model"" in scenic areas such as the Dabie Mountains (a 30% commission on each flight revenue). If this model works, the proportion of operation revenue will exceed 20% in 2025, and the valuation system will shift to that of a SaaS company (8-10 times PS), which means at least a 50% room for correction.

IV. **Risk Warnings**: The Three Major Risk Points I Closely Track

Although I am optimistic in the long term, I do not shy away from risks. The following are the variables that may subvert the logic:

1.**The Mass Production of Solid-state Batteries Is Delayed**: The technical route of the Hefei Research Institute has not been tested in winter low temperatures. If it cannot be mass-produced in Q3 2025, the endurance advantage will be diluted.

2.**Local Government Debt Drags Down Infrastructure Construction**: The construction of low-altitude takeoff and landing points depends on government investment. If the fiscal policy is tightened, it may lead to lower-than-expected implementation of scenarios.

3.**Intensified Competition**: The entry of international competitors such as Joby (PS 69 times) and domestic competitors such as XPeng Aeroht (with pre-sales exceeding 3,000 aircraft) may squeeze market share and affect the valuation premium.

**Conclusion**: My Positioning Strategy and Key Nodes

As an analyst with a heavy position in EHang, my operation logic is very clear:

●**In the short term**: The approval of the OC certificate (Q1 2025) and the delivery volume in Q1 (target of more than 200 aircraft) are the catalysts for the stock price. If the stock price falls below the 20-day moving average, reduce the position periodically.

●**In the long term**: Hold until the end of 2025. The target price corresponds to a PS of 8 times in 2026 (revenue of 2 billion yuan), and the expected upside is 120%.

**Finally, a reminder**: eVTOL is not a short-term speculation concept, and one needs to endure the fluctuations of policy and technological iteration. But if you believe that the urban sky will eventually be reshaped, EHang may be the sharpest spear in the next decade.",,reddit/investing

I’m not sure if everyone fully understands just how much this is going to affect the global economy, but we’re about to see a chain reaction that could send the stock market into freefall.

Here’s why I think the worst is still ahead of us:

1. **Lockdowns Are Going to Crush Businesses** Businesses everywhere are already starting to feel the strain. We’re talking about massive industries grinding to a halt, retail stores closing their doors, restaurants shuttering indefinitely, and airlines cutting flights. This isn’t just a temporary slowdown – lockdowns will stop economic activity for an indefinite amount of time. If this goes on for months, there’s no way the stock market can keep up. When companies start reporting losses, investors will panic, and the selling will begin. Expect major corrections, or worse.
2. **Unemployment Is About to Skyrocket** With businesses forced to close their doors, people are going to lose jobs. The service industry, retail, and entertainment sectors will be hit hardest. Once this happens, consumer confidence will plummet, and spending will slow to a crawl. People won’t be buying as much, and businesses won’t be able to recover. This is a recipe for disaster, and it’s hard to imagine the stock market staying afloat when millions of people are suddenly out of work.
3. **The Stock Market Is Overvalued and Fragile** Let’s face it – the stock market has been on an unsustainable upward trajectory for years. Investors have been riding high on the expectation of steady growth, but now reality is setting in. Once the full scope of the pandemic hits, markets will react. We could be looking at the worst crash since the 2008 financial crisis. The economy is about to go into a tailspin, and the stock market doesn’t stand a chance.
4. **Long-Term Economic Recession** It’s not just a temporary dip in the market. Once the dust settles, we’re looking at a long-term economic slowdown. The global economy relies on constant movement – constant production and consumption. If that stops, it’ll take years to recover. And let’s not forget, governments can’t just keep printing money forever without inflation catching up. We could see hyperinflation, followed by another round of economic pain for the average consumer.

**I don’t mean to be an alarmist, but now is the time to start preparing for a rough ride ahead.** If you’ve got money tied up in the stock market, I’d seriously consider whether you want to ride out this coming crash. The world is about to change in ways we can’t predict, but we know one thing for sure: the stock market is going to be hit HARD.

401K ($14k)- contributing 6% which my employer matches 100%, 100% allocated to VOO.

Roth Ira, I have been maxing it for the past few years and have about $36k mostly allocated to VOO.

Taxable Brokerage - $3000 - random funds.

The goal i have is to allocate it between SCHD/JEPI/O/VOO/QQQM.

How would you guys build this portfolio?

Thanks in advance!!",,reddit/investing

2025-04-08 18:37:25,"Portfolio Rebalancing / Allocation Strategies Afternoon All,

I (56m) rebalanced my company sponsored (Merrill Lynch managed) portfolio in late January.  Overall portfolio at the time was a bit heavy with conservative investments (bonds, stable value, etc.) - probably around a 60% conservative / 40% aggressive balance.

After rebalancing, I shifted a bit to a more aggressive (55% stocks / equities, 35% stable value and 10% bonds) portfolio.  I have “ridden the current wave” and, to this point, have been hit to the tune of a (6%) loss since rebalancing.

Although results over the 6 years will ultimately be the determining factor, my plan was to retire at 62.  Currently, I have been thinking that I would continue investing as my allocation currently sits with the mindset that, while I do understand that we have probably not “hit bottom”, I would be buying at a reduced amount if nothing else.  However, I am also thinking perhaps my overall portfolio should include more bonds.  A few questions I have - would appreciate your thoughts / guidance on:

1:  is my 35% stable value plus 10% bond allocation (together) “conservative enough” given my age?  Should I have more allocated to bonds and less to stable value?

2.  If I proceeded with a rebalance at this time, concerned I would be selling my stocks / equities at a loss.  Would it be better to try and weather the storm before rebalancing or pull the trigger now?

3.  Would it make sense to consider a full portfolio rebalance to target date fund (say 2030 or 2035)?  I have not ever included TDF’s in my portfolio and the common thinking is that this is an “all or nothing” approach from most folks…assuming if this would be a good approach that the 2035 would be more aggressive at this time while the 2030 would probably be an even blend aggressive to conservative and continue in the conservative direction.  While “protecting the house” is certainly a concern at my age, I don’t want to get involved in a fund that doesn’t let me recoup the bit I have taken by being too conservative.

Long read and truly appreciate your thoughts.

Thank you!

2025-04-08 17:02:15,"Thoughts on ETFs focusing on the Far East? So, I have been browsing numerous different ETFs with all sorts of specifics, and when browsing Asian ETFs I realised there are none that quite offer what I would consider intriguing as a small position.

Eventually, I stumbled upon a few ""Far East"" ETFs and thought their composition (or the one of one in particular) was quite interesting.  
It offers China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea & Singapore alongside Thailand, Indonesia & Malaysia.

So, really, apart from India & maybe Vietnam, those are arguably all of the Asian (ex-Japan) countries that people might expect to have high sustained growth potential going forward alongside the some of the more established ""safer"" bets.

So, I'm wondering - what do you think about this? What do you think about this ETF?  
If you wanted to get involved with Asia, which countries would you like to see represented instead & what do you generally expect from Asia/these regions going forward?

ETF in question:

Disclaimer: I will **not** buy this ETF, and that's decided, regardless of what gets commented here. Between the small size,the high TER & the general uncertainty around large parts of S/SE Asia, it's a clear no from me, even for a small position.  
Still interested in your thoughts, though.

Then the recovery took off… and I missed it.

	•	Inflation, interest rates, AI boom, and global instability all make me hesitate
	•	I’m still just sitting here with half a million dollars, unsure of the “right” move

Here’s what’s holding me back:
	•	I don’t want to buy in at the top
	•	I worry about inflation eating my cash
	•	I’m tired of trying to time the market — but scared of going all in
	•	I’d love passive growth, but also safety

I’m not looking for a magic answer, just real talk:

2025-04-08 14:04:02,"My analysis of the market Since last summer, I’ve been posting monthly updates over at a subreddit I created, r/investorinsights, mostly as a way to step back and see the market more clearly.

For a while, those updates were pretty uneventful—because, frankly, the market was behaving. But with all the recent volatility, I think there’s more value in sharing the research I’ve been doing. So I figured I’d post the April update here for anyone who might find it helpful.


**InvestorInsights April 2025 Update**

Market Volatility: A Gut Check, Not a Crisis

The S&P 500 is down quite a bit from its February high, finishing March at 5,811.85. That puts us right back where we were last July—like a roller coaster that forgot how to climb. The Nasdaq Composite has taken an even bigger hit, down 14% since December.

This kind of pullback isn’t new, and it’s not the end of the world. In fact, it’s part of the natural cycle. What's especially notable is the $7 trillion sitting in money market accounts right now. That’s a massive amount of capital sitting on the sidelines, waiting for a clearer signal to re-enter. History suggests much of it eventually will.

If you’re already invested, the best move may be to simply keep going. Timing the market is a losing game.

Economic Signals: A Mixed Bag

There’s plenty of conflicting data out there. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting -0.5% GDP growth for Q1—technically a contraction—while the New York Fed is estimating +2.9%. That’s a massive spread, and it reflects just how uncertain this environment is.

That said, reacting to short-term data with long-term money rarely ends well. A sound financial plan is designed to weather both good quarters and bad ones.

Trucking and Rail: Positive Movement

In more encouraging news, the American Trucking Associations’ Tonnage Index rose 3% in February. Trucking moves over 70% of the goods in the U.S., so when tonnage rises, it's a sign of life. Rail traffic is also up 4.2% year-to-date, with intermodal shipments climbing 8.2%.

That tells us that goods are moving and commerce is flowing—both good signs beneath the market noise.

Housing Market: Under Pressure

The housing sector continues to face challenges. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to 39 in March—its lowest in seven months. Builder sentiment is being weighed down by rising material costs (including tariffs that add an estimated $9,200 per home) and ongoing policy uncertainty.

The Northeast is the most resilient region, but elsewhere, construction is slowing. If you’re looking to buy or build, it might be wise to exercise patience.

Inflation: Still Sticky

Inflation remains persistent. Core PCE, the Fed’s preferred metric, was up 2.8% year-over-year in February. Short-term interest rates are now north of 3%, which is starting to bite into borrowing and spending.

But this isn’t a 1970s-style runaway inflation scenario. Prices are still rising, yes—but they’re rising more slowly, and the Fed is keeping a close eye on the trend.

Federal Reserve: Staying the Course

The Fed kept interest rates steady last month at 4.25%–4.5% and is slowing the pace of balance sheet reduction starting in April. This suggests they’re aiming for a “soft landing”—bringing inflation down without tipping the economy into recession.

It’s a tricky balance, but so far, they’re not rocking the boat too much.

Final Word: Stay Disciplined

Headlines will always focus on the drama—but don’t let noise drive your decisions. Downturns are a normal part of investing, and history consistently rewards those who stay the course.

Think of this moment like a sale on high-quality assets. If you’re still in the accumulation phase, market dips aren’t something to fear—they’re opportunities.

Ten years from now, today’s turbulence will be a blip in your rearview mirror. Focus on what you can control: your savings rate, your asset allocation, and your mindset. Let time do the rest.",,reddit/investing

2025-04-08 11:56:52,"Childrens Place - Earnings Friday After Close - Expecting Buyout The Childrens Place is a prominent budget retailer specializing in children's apparel and accessories with its headquarters in New Jersey. The company has had a volatile past with net income in 2022 reaching 257m and market cap exceeding 1 Billion to losses in January 2024 year ending of 154m.The once $105 stock hit its all time low of $4.77 in September 2024.

The company dropped from $46 to $8 from December 2023 to February 2024 due to weak financials and increased losses.

**Mithaq Capital:**

In February 2024 Mithaq Capital acquired 54% of shares at a purchase price of $13.96 and also provided aa 90m interest free loan to Childrens Place. Mithaq capital appointed new board members and essentially took over control of the company. They started to prioritize shutting down all loss generating stores effective immediately and cut back on the flash sales/significant discounts.

**Q1 2024 Financials (prior to board control**

Revenue - 268m

COGS - 175M

OP Exp - 120M

Net Loss - 28M

**Q2 2024 Financials (new business model)**

Revenue - 320m

COGS - 208m

Op Exp - 106M

Net Income - 6m

**Q3 2024**

Revenue - 390m

Cogs - 251M

Op Exp - 109M

Net Income - 29M

  
In a 6 month span Mithaq was able to significantly cut back on operating expenses and increase gross margins resulting in PLCE becoming profitable again.

Childrens Place announced preliminary Q4 data in December 2024 where it noted that there was a 3.4% increase in sales from prior year same quarter. This would suggested a Q4 revenue of $470m, significantly beating estimates of 390m. The shares popped on this news to $14 and Childrens Place announced a offering. Mithaq Capital acquired more shares in February 2025 and did a offering to existing shareholders. Mithaq increased its ownership from 54% to 62% during this capital raise at $9.75 which at the time was a 30% discount to current market value. These funds were used to pay down long term debt. Mithaqs average cost base on their 14m shares owned is around $11.50.

**Q4 Earnings March 11, 2025 After Close - Why a Buyout is Coming**

Childrens Place will be reporting its Q4 earnings after close this Friday. Here is what to expect:

Preliminary data for Q4 showed a 3.4% increase in net sales from prior year.  
  
Revenue estimate:  
  
24Q4:470M  
23Q4:455M  
  
With 470M sales quarter then it should have operating income close to 45-50m for Q4 while trading at a market cap 120m. of This is under the assumption same gross margin and only a 5% increase in operational expenses which is in line with previous quarters.

**Guidance** \- I expect a significant jump in guidance for FY 2025.

Web Traffic is showing a 40%-50% increase year over year when looking at January to March. (150k visitors vs 112k)Expecting sales guidance to be in the 1.7B range at the minimum. They have also partnered with Shein last October and are actively selling on Shein's store front - to date over 300k sales orders have been recorded on that store front in 6 months.

**Why I expect a buyout-**

**1) Company Updates and Board/Management Changes -** the company has gone dark on giving us updates since they did the capital raise in December. Historically PLCE announced preliminary numbers and net income the first week of February. Childrens Place has also not made any announcements since the share offering and has had substantial changes in Board/CFO/Management which is all very common when a buyout is coming from a majority holder.

**2) Tariffs are a great thing** \-owns $500m of inventory as of year end. These tariffs essentially increase the value of that inventory by 40%. As the price hikes will be passed to customers and all current inventory has already seen prices inflated for these increase in expected costs. Mithaq is essentially getting a $200m premium on the purchase.

**3)Current Price** \- PLCE is trading at $6.32 and is at a 6 month low. Mithaq's current cost base is roughly $11.50 per share. Mithaq can low ball a offer of $10 a share and still give current premium of 58% to current shareholders.

**4)Earnings Timing -** never reported earnings on a Friday after close - even last May when they knew they were going to have a record loss year. Childrens Place is also not have a earnings call rather a letter to shareholders on Friday after close which all buyouts occur through this method.

**5)Taking Private -** Mithaq acquiring the remaining 8m shares would allow them to take this company private at a total cost of around 225m (22m shares - average $10-11). I expected Mithaq to take Childrens place public again sometime in 2026-2027 after PLCE has a full year of 30-50m net income quarters,

**TLDR:**  
PLCE - Budget kids clothing store has gone through significant changes during 2024 when Mithaq Capital acquired 54% of the company at the start of February 2024. Mithaq cut waste/closed loss generating stores and has turned the company around from losing 28M a quarter to net income of 29M over a 9 month period. Mithaq increased its holdings to 64% at the start of 2025 and since then PLCE has gone dark with business updates and changed majority of its management team. Earnings are Friday after close and all estimates point to a blow out based on December store sales growth year over year + 40% increase in traffic. No earnings call is taking place only a letter to shareholders which has never happened historically. PLCE is trading at a 60% discount to where it was last quarter and my best guess is Mithaq is going to offer a buyout in the $11-12 range for the remaining 8M shares and take the company private. Worst case is no buyout and you are holding a company that is significantly undervalued to its peers and will beat on earnings.

2025-04-08 09:55:21,"5 year investment plan for house deposit Hi everyone,

I’m currently invested quite heavily invested a Legal & General Global Technology Index Fund, which is heavily weighted in US technology stocks. I’m confident that this fund will perform well in the long term, and am well aware that right now is a fantastic opportunity to buy if you’re looking for a long term investment. However, with the ongoing risks (like the impact of Trump’s tariffs on US tech companies), I’m starting to reconsider my strategy as I may need to access this money in the next 5 years for a house deposit.

Given the relatively short to medium-term nature of my goal (roughly 5 years), I’m wondering if anyone has advice on shifting my investment strategy or if there’s a more balanced approach I should consider.

Has anyone here gone through a similar situation or have any recommendations for a 5-year investment portfolio? Would you stick with equities like tech, or do you think a more diversified portfolio (maybe with bonds or REITs) would be safer in this timeframe?

2025-04-08 09:42:53,"Stop repeating the ""50% loss requires 100% gain"" thing, it's not that insightful I’m getting fed up with people parroting the line ""if you lose 50%, you need to gain 100% to break even"" as if it revealed something important about risk. It’s a misleading way to think about how markets work, and those people seem to imply that it's somehow more unlikely for stocks to go back to their previous value after a drop? Otherwise I don't really understand why they keep repeating this line.

Markets move multiplicatively, not additively. Stock prices follow something close to geometric Brownian motion, a random walk **on a log scale**. In a multiplicative world, the symmetry is between ratios, not percent changes.

Assuming no drift, if you look at a stock price **on a log scale**, you will notice that the probability of a green candle and the probability of a red candle of the same size are equal. A 2x gain and a 0.5x loss are symmetric. A -50% drop and a +100% gain are equal and opposite **on a log scale**. Same for -20% and +25% or whatever other example you want to use.

And if you assume even a small positive drift, which reflects long-term market behavior, then the probability of doubling actually becomes **greater** than that of halving.

If a stock lost 50% due to some unexpected bad news, but it later turned out that the news was entirely fake, the price would go back to its original value i.e. +100%. It would not just gain back +50%.

There's nothing deep or meaningful about saying that you need +100% to compensate for -50%. That's just pointing out a basic fact of math and how percentages work, but it's pretty useless to keep repeating this as if it had a deep meaning.",,reddit/investing

2025-04-08 08:24:00,"Is it just me or is anyone else concerned that China will threaten to invade Taiwan? Is it just me, or is anyone else concerned that China might threaten to invade Taiwan to posture a response to the Trump tariffs?

With the trade war heating up and neither side backing down, pressure is definitely getting to both sides. The People’s Bank of China just set the midpoint rate for the onshore yuan at 7.2038 per dollar—the weakest level since September 2023. Could this force China to start playing their hand? As a last attempt to regain leverage, couldn’t they just threaten Taiwan?

We already have the Ukraine-Russia war dragging on, which Trump claimed he’d resolve on day one—but hasn’t. There’s still an escalating conflict between Israel and Gaza, and now the U.S. is hinting at bombing Iran if a new nuclear deal isn’t reached.

On top of that, the general outlook on tariffs is rattling Wall Street. CEOs who once backed Trump—like Elon and Bill Ackman—are now publicly opposing the tariffs. If China plays the Taiwan card and threatens the global tech and AI supply chain, couldn’t that send the U.S. economy into shambles?

At the end of the day, it’s about who holds the cards right. Trump may believe China will fold under economic pressure—but what if they don’t? What if China bluffs and leverages the U.S. stock market’s vulnerability, or worse, disrupts AI sentiment through Taiwan’s semiconductor production?

So the question is, why not? ",,reddit/investing

2025-04-08 05:32:25,"How China’s Restrictions on Rare Earth Mineral Exports would Affect the EV Industry China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, notably tightened as of April 4, 2025, are poised to significantly impact the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for the high-performance magnets in EV motors, while elements like lanthanum are used in batteries. China controls roughly 60-70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it a chokehold on the supply chain that the U.S. EV sector heavily relies on.
The immediate effect is supply disruption. The U.S. imports about 74% of its rare earths from China (down from 80% a decade ago), and with export controls escalating—starting with gallium, germanium, and graphite in 2023 and expanding to other rare earths in 2024 and 2025—manufacturers like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford could face shortages. A single EV motor can require 1-2 kilograms of rare earth magnets, and with U.S. EV sales projected to hit 1.5-2 million units annually by 2030, the demand for these materials is massive. Without a steady supply, production lines could slow or halt, delaying deliveries and driving up costs.
Cost increases are already in motion. Post-restriction price spikes have historical precedent: in 2011, when China cut exports, rare earth prices soared—neodymium hit $67,000 per metric ton. Recent data shows neodymium at $75,097 per metric ton and dysprosium up 4.65% to $250.60 per kilogram as of late 2024, with analysts expecting further climbs in 2025 due to these bans. EVs already use six times more minerals than conventional cars, and with graphite (another restricted mineral) being the largest component in battery anodes (up to 136 pounds per EV), battery prices could jump 18% or more, pushing sticker prices higher and potentially slowing consumer adoption.
Geopolitical leverage amplifies the strain. China’s moves are a response to U.S. tariffs and tech curbs, like the Biden administration’s December 2024 semiconductor export limits. With 90% of heavy rare earths (like dysprosium, critical for EV motor heat resistance) processed in China, a full ban could cripple production timelines. The U.S. has only one active rare earth mine—Mountain Pass in California—producing 15% of global supply, but it lacks sufficient domestic processing capacity. MP Materials, the operator, ships much of its output to China for refining, and its Fort Worth magnet facility won’t be fully online until late 2025 at earliest.
Mitigation efforts are underway but slow. The U.S. is investing in domestic supply chains—Biden’s 2021 Executive Order 14017 and the Inflation Reduction Act pump millions into mining and recycling—but scaling up takes years. Alternatives like Australia (10% of global supply) or Vietnam exist, but their output is dwarfed by China’s, and processing still often routes through Chinese facilities. Recycling could offset 30% of future rare earth demand, yet only 1% is currently recycled in the U.S. Tesla’s shift away from rare earths in next-gen motors is promising, but it’s not yet scalable across the industry.
The EV industry faces a triple hit: delayed production, higher costs, and strategic vulnerability. A total graphite ban alone could slash EV output, given China’s 77% share of natural graphite and 95% of synthetic graphite production. Add rare earth curbs, and the U.S. could lose ground in the global EV race, with economic losses estimated at $3.4 billion in GDP from just gallium and germanium restrictions. Without rapid diversification or innovation, China’s restrictions could stall America’s electric dreams.

2025-04-08 02:16:45,"Maintaining Sanity When Someone Screams Fire! What to learn from Charli and Warren. **Maintaining Sanity in Market Madness: The Art of Clear Thinking When Others Panic**

In the unpredictable world of financial markets, perhaps the most valuable asset isn't found in any portfolio but resides within ourselves: a clear, disciplined mind. When markets become volatile and participants succumb to collective panic, the ability to maintain rational thought becomes not just advantageous but essential. As the saying goes, ""The mind is the ultimate measure of the man,"" and surrendering one's rational thinking, even momentarily, can lead to devastating financial consequences. While there is no perfect solution to the psychological challenges of investing, there are practical approaches that can serve as anchors during turbulent times.

* The Foundation: Know What You Own

The first principle of maintaining mental clarity in chaotic markets is surprisingly simple yet frequently overlooked: know precisely what you own and why you own it. More importantly, write it down. This documentation process serves multiple purposes. It forces clarity of thought at the time of purchase, creating a record uncontaminated by future market movements or emotional states. When markets plunge and fear takes hold, these written records become invaluable reference points, reminding us of the rational analysis that led to our decisions.

This documentation need not be complex—a simple statement of the business fundamentals, competitive advantages, and your thesis for ownership suffices. The act of writing crystallizes thought and creates a touchstone to return to when markets test your resolve. Without this anchor, investors often find themselves adrift in a sea of market opinions, unable to distinguish between sound reasoning and fear-driven reactions

* The Microscope Over the Telescope: Focus on Business, Not Economics

The second principle challenges conventional wisdom: forget macro economics. While economic forecasts make for interesting reading and discussion, they rarely translate into actionable investment insights. Instead, keep your attention fixed on the businesses you own and only on them. This narrow focus is not ignorance but discipline.

Great companies navigate through various economic cycles, often emerging stronger from downturns as weaker competitors falter. By concentrating on company-specific metrics—cash flow, competitive positioning, management quality, and growth prospects—investors insulate themselves from the noise of economic predictions that often prove wrong. The question isn't whether GDP will grow by 2% or 3%, but whether your businesses' competitive advantages remain intact and their long-term prospects sound.

* The Golden Rule: Time as the Ultimate Multiplier

Perhaps the most powerful principle is the recognition that ""Money is made in owning great businesses for long periods."" This golden rule stands in stark contrast to the frenetic trading that often characterizes market behavior during volatile periods. The compounding effect of high returns on capital over decades creates wealth that short-term trading simply cannot match.

This perspective transforms how we view market downturns. Rather than threats, they become opportunities to acquire more ownership in excellent businesses at favorable prices. The investor who understands this principle sees volatility not as something to fear but as the very mechanism that creates opportunity. Without the occasional panic, premium businesses would rarely become available at reasonable prices.

* The Psychology of Serenity: Avoiding Imagined Troubles

The fourth principle addresses the psychological dimension of investing: don't suffer imagined troubles. Mark Twain famously said, ""I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened."" In investing, this wisdom is particularly relevant. Markets constantly present potential catastrophes to worry about, most of which never materialize or prove far less severe than feared.

The discipline of distinguishing between actual business problems and theoretical market concerns is crucial. Has something fundamentally changed in your business, or are prices simply reflecting temporary uncertainty? This distinction helps prevent the costly mistake of selling quality assets during market panics, only to repurchase them at higher prices when confidence returns.

* The Balanced Life: Investment as a Component, Not the Whole

The final principle extends beyond investing itself: get another hobby and don't forget to live life. Investing should be an important but not all-consuming activity. Those who allow market movements to dominate their thoughts and emotions inevitably make poorer decisions. The investor who maintains outside interests and perspective can step back from market turbulence with greater ease. Gardening is my balast and its a hobby I'd reccomend!

This balance serves a practical purpose beyond just quality of life. Distance from the daily noise of markets often leads to clearer thinking about long-term value. Many of history's most successful investors are known not for their frenetic activity but for their patience and ability to ignore short-term market movements in favor of long-term business outcomes.

# The Integrated Approach

These five principles work together as a system rather than isolated tactics. The investor who knows what they own and why, focuses on business fundamentals rather than economic predictions, understands the power of long-term ownership, avoids imagined troubles, and maintains life balance possesses a formidable psychological advantage.

In practice, this approach might mean reviewing your written investment theses during market declines rather than market commentary. It might mean turning off financial news during volatile periods to focus instead on the quarterly reports of businesses you own. It certainly means resisting the urge to make major portfolio changes based on short-term market movements or economic predictions.

# Conclusion

In the final analysis, the investor who maintains their composure when others lose theirs not only preserves capital but positions themselves to capitalize on the opportunities that market dislocations invariably create. Perhaps that is the ultimate advantage: the ability to act rationally when rationality is in shortest supply.",,reddit/investing

A marginal increase in negative actions was observed, with downgrades surpassing upgrades by a single downgrade. Additionally, S&P Global reported a significant rise in high-risk credits this week.

  
There were three new risky credits (issuers in the 'CCC' rating category) last week. While most rating performance metrics have improved year-on-year, the number of risky credit additions has notably increased so far this year to 22 from 16 over the same period in 2024.

2025-04-07 20:01:42,"Don't like how our broker treated us I think he is a broker. He handles our investments in a large investment company. We decided we wanted to pull our investments because we are seriously worried about them as they are literally our only savings. Our broker tried talking to us and saying he's been in the business a long  time and he's seen this before in 2022 and etc but we are really worried about a tariff war and recession/depression. We would be totally cool with letting the money sit in the bank and not make money rather than lose it. I've lost 5k since Friday. Yes things will get better but how long will it take and how low will we go and how many years to recover before making a profit again? I had a really good year last year but the new government down south will be in power for 4 years and this is the only money we have. Mom is retired and I work but not much above minimum wage. 

He got very upset, aggressive (i felt) and angry almost. He said it was his job to help us make the right decision and this was the wrong decision. That he is telling us, like everyone is being told, to be patient and wait, things will get back to normal. He said when it comes to investing there are two types of people, those who are afraid and those that are greedy. I didn't like him putting it as greed vs fear, though i agree with the fear. My mom was terrified about losing the money and she has bad nerves. We look back and think my brother pressured us to invest because getting lump of money was too tempting and could easily be blown. My mom is not the investing type. She's 79, should she really be playing the long game? 

To compromise i said I'd keep my investments going and she can take.hers but he was still pushing pushing pushing. Talking about trends and blah, blah, blah. 
He said mom's investment is low risk and that she only lost 1% and if she invested 50k or 1m it would still be 1% but if she cashed 1m less 1% she would had a heck of a lot more money than 1% of 50k (he investment is closer to the 50k definitely not the 1m) and 1% of 50k would hurt a hell of a lot more so I don't think his comparison is valid.

I don't like how pushy he was. Even if it's a bad decision investment wise, it's still our money and our decision. We agreed to wait a week and he seemed happy. He sould not be happy or angry or disappointed, this is business but I know it affects him with his income (how exactly I'm not sure but I'm sure it does). He wanted us to Google to see what experts are saying and read and think and i think we are more convinced we aren't comfortable with him. I can totally see him going to my brother since he recommended him and he's like next of kin to take over if mom dies.  
I don't know if i trust the media as i see how biased they are. Can I trust the news to tell me the truth? Are business experts trying to keep the market from getting worse with people like us wanting to take our money and run? If the tariff war is going to lead to a recession would the news or the experts really tell us before it's too late?

So thoughts on the behaviour of this broker? Or financial advisor though broker is easier to type.

TLDR: my financial advisor is saying not to pull our money but seemed upset we wanted to",,reddit/investing

I’m 39 years old and have been investing consistently since 2009.  I lucked out on when I began investing and the bull run that I’ve lived in.  

Because of the large amount of gains I’ve experienced, this drop would have to be MUCH larger to get be to rethink my consistent investing strategy.  I view it as a normal (albeit abnormal at the same time) drop in the life of the long-term positive progress of the US market.

* Sign a contract that establishes the law to be followed is from the investor's country of origin;
* Offer more equity because of the risk involved;
* Having an international manager from the start.

But even with this, it's been very tough to find someone who agrees to invest.

Trump has taken up with an inflated stock market, inverted yields, terrible interest rates and a slowing economy. Weirdly enough the job market stayed consistent so the market kept going. 

I see trump crashing the stock market as a push for demand of treasury bonds. A higher price on bonds pushes for lower interest rates on bonds which tend to push borrowing costs down for the government and companies. This usually happens when the market goes down as well.

Will the negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's stock enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

\---------------------------------------

For those looking for something to read, here you go:

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain.

Here is a great interview with the well-respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those who do not want to watch the whole video, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".

1. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends.

1. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*

1. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.

1. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession.

1. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us).

1. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the ""little guy"" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices.

1. America is a consumer-based economy (\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is ""no tomorrow"". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.

1. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).

1. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business have very long time-cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.

1. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.

1. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. This will cause more market volatility.

1. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is ""half done"" in his view.

One thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administration’s haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.

I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more ""TLDR"" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out as being far more likely to be of great benefit to China in both the near term and long run. Not America.

Back to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a ""possibility"" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:

6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR) (\*a lot has changed in the three days since I made this chart/post).

While the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from its recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the ""Trump Bump"" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and ""meh"" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen any *real* damage to its share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon!

I know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: ""*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*"" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as ""Tesler"". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF).

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised his voters that he would do.

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the rosiest picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself).

If there is real and lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers (Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future) boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow.

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost (and counting). While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a Band-Aid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time.

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla.

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

2025-04-07 16:01:15,"The current state of the stock market and how to think about your personal way forward I know a lot of people are freaking out right now about the stock market.  

Moments like this are why the stock market is meant for long term investing.  You can lose money in the short term.  Your emergency fund should not be in the stock market. Moments like this are also why people close to retirement should not be all in on stocks (unless they have another source of income like a pension).  

Selling locks in losses.  In some situations, locking in those losses might be the right plan.  In a lot of situations, holding on to the shares is the wiser strategy. If you have 20+ years until retirement, you have plenty of time for your shares to rebound.  But if you see yourself definitely needing some of the invested money in the next five years, you may want to make a different choice.

Target Date Funds are popular for retirement accounts because they are designed to be less volatile due to their mix of US, international, and bonds.  They also become less risky the closer they get to the expected retirement age.  Right now, VOO is down 15% since the beginning of the year.  Vanguard 2040 is down less than 8% and Vanguard 2060 is down less than 10%.  More conservative options are less volatile.  

VOO and chill is very big on Reddit, but while VOO is down 15%, VXUS is down less than 5%.  You might want to consider the [Bogleheads strategy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started) which also has its own subreddit.  If you currently have high risk investments, one option is to let those ride, but change how you invest new money.  Meaning let your VOO position ride while adding in VXUS and BND (or whatever you choose).

I highly recommend these two articles:

*Out of 1,034 stocks traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), a total of 945, including contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), fell by the maximum 10 percent amid concerns that the tariffs could undermine global trade, dealers added.*

*The Taiex, the TWSE's benchmark weighted index, ended down 2,065.87 points, or 9.7 percent, at 19,232.35 after moving between 19,212.02 and 20,153.57.*

*It was the first time the index had closed below the 20,000-point mark since Aug. 5, 2024, when it ended at 19,830.88.*

*Monday's losses were the steepest ever in the Taiex's history, smashing the previous record of 1,807.21 also seen on Aug. 5, 2024, when disappointing U.S. data prompted investors to worry about the economy.*

**Despite the sell-off, turnover on the local market totaled only NT$147.295 billion (US$4.44 billion), the lowest single day total in more than two years.**

**""The low turnover showed many investors were reluctant to buy the dip as they expect more losses to follow due to the tariff shocks,"" Mega International Investment Services analyst Alex Huang said.**

*On April 2, Trump announced a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from most countries, with the exception of Russia, North Korea, Cuba and Belarus, starting April 5.*

*Countries with larger trade surpluses with the U.S. will face higher tariffs starting April 9, including Taiwan (32 percent), China (34 percent), Japan (24 percent), South Korea (26 percent), Vietnam (46 percent) and Thailand (37 percent).*

*China took retaliatory action soon after Trump's newest move.*

*""The 32 percent tariff Taiwan faces went beyond what the market had expected, in particular after TSMC pledged (in March) to pour an additional US$100 billion into Arizona in support of Trump's advocacy for investment in the U.S. market,"" Huang said.*

*TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock here, plunged 10 percent to close at NT$848.00, contributing more than 750 points to the Taiex's decline and contributing to a 9.71 percent decline in the electronics index.*

**""Orders to sell an additional 68 million TSMC shares failed to find buyers today. More selling will follow after the market opens tomorrow as investors fear Trump's tariffs will boost inflation and lead to a recession,"" Huang said.**

…

*Huang said non-tech heavyweights also came under heavy pressure, pushing the Taiex down further.*

*""There are few signs of any immediate rebound as the Taiex, which resumed trading today after the last session on April 2, needs to incur more losses to match global volatility,"" Huang said. ""So a similar trading pattern is likely for tomorrow.""*

*Measures to curb short selling were put in place before trading Monday and will remain in effect through Friday in a bid to calm the market, though it made little impact Monday.*

2025-04-07 10:56:43,"Are the tariffs the real problem or just a reality check? Disclaimer: not an American and I have little interest in politics, my question/opinion is solely a financial one.

So everyone is blaming Trump for the recent drop in the stock market, and losing them money, and yes, if you look at the small picture this is due to the tariffs.

But this also contradicts something that people constantly say. ""Time in the market beats timing the market"" (implying that the stock market should average out and trend up over time, so it's better to slowly invest over time you should be better off).

If we read this and agree, then it seems we have nothing to worry about, because $600 ($SPY as an example) was the true value based on fundamentals and the economy over all, then eventually it will reach that price again.

But I think the big issue is that it should never have been valued that high. After COVID, which was a legitimate reason for a drop in the markets worldwide, the US Government (or the Federal Reserve which acts independently to the elected Government I believe) printed off and invested trillions and trillions of dollars into the stock market, and also gave out money, which a lot of bored people used to invest in the stock market.

This, and the coinciding tech boom caused by people working from home and being at home more often, created a generation of people who think that the stock market is an unlimited money glitch which only ever goes up with absolutely no consequences, and now they are shocked that it isn't the case after all.

So while Trump's tariffs kicked off this recent drop, is it something that has been coming for a long time and is way overdue? Had it not happened, and the market value had continued to increase, would it not be even more severe when something else caused a sell-off?

After all, if $600 is the true value of $SPY then should it not quickly recover as it's now so obviously undervalued. So while this may be self inflicted, and cannot be compared to the drop due to COVID, is it completely irrelevant to the true issue at hand, which is a bubble that was going to burst eventually?",,reddit/investing

Which of the below represents the correct way to calculate the rate of return percentage after the withholding tax:

1) 8% - 1.39% = 6.61% rate of return after the withholding tax

2) 100% (representing the entire 8% rate of return) - 1.39% = 98.61%

I am invested since 10 years and DCA into MSCI World and an additional EM Index fund for diversification. Also I have some high quality/boring stocks in my portfolio. Given the strong US exposure of the MSCI World I intent to increase the exp to Europe.

I am no expert by any stretch but this downturn feels different, more structural because of political agendas rather economic issues. Hence my reduction to US exposure and increasing to Europe and maybe Asia…

2025-04-07 07:30:49,"Lets play the call the bottom game 2025 edition! SO there are no fabulous prizes other than maybe trying to catch a falling knife but lets put forth our best estimates of where the bottom could be.  If possible be sure to include your reasoning.  Here is my guess:

So the S&P was at 6144 on Feb 19th then we had the first Tariff shock and it sank roughly to 5500 (in part bouncing off 10% correction and then going back to about 5600-5700 range).  At that time Goldman Sachs noted consensus was the tariff announcement in early April would yield about 8% so the market was priced about right going into April 2nd (about 8% down from peak).  Then we had the announcement with a weighted average of about 24% tariff across all trading partners (JP Morgan numbers)  rather that the 8% the market expected.  If it were only that simple then we could reasonably expect the pricing in to be 24% below the 6144 peak or around another 14% down from the 5500 short term bottom before the april 2 announcement.  That number is about S&P 4700. 

BUT the market also now knows atleast some countries / regions will enact tariffs of there own in response although not all will.  This stands to further cause impact but remember they also clearly realize that reprisal tariffs hurt there own companies as much as they hurt the US also, the German, Spanish, Italian finance ministers have even voiced this since the announcement .  SO Im going to guess they take a more modest approach on average across all trading partners.  Im going to guess they do what the market expected the US to do in the first place which is a consensus of 8%.  So that takes 4700 down by another 8% to just around 4300.   If they were to do 10% instead then that would be more like 4200.   The S&P was trading at around 24 P:E on april 2, income will ofcourse dip going forward but the trailing P:E would be reduced to about 18.  It could easily overshoot but im sticking to my guess of **4300** what is everyone elses best guess.",,reddit/investing

2025-04-07 03:36:21,"Should I Invest $10K From a 0% APR Credit Card Into Index Funds? (Unemployed Right Now) 
Hey all,

I'm considering doing something a bit risky and wanted some honest feedback.

I have a 0% APR credit card with a $10,000 limit and an 18-month promotional period before interest kicks in. I was thinking: what if I invest that $10K into a broad index fund like VOO or SPY?

The logic is that the market *usually* trends up over time, and I could walk away with a few hundred to a few thousand in profit before paying off the card — assuming I sell and repay the balance before the 0% period ends.

Here’s the catch:  
**I'm currently unemployed.** No steady income right now, though I’m working on it. I don’t have any major debt, and I’ve got a small emergency fund — but not enough to cover the full $10K if the market tanks.

Also — does anyone know which **brokerages are safest** when using a credit card for funding? Or is that not even an option? I’ve used Fidelity and Schwab before with bank transfers, but I’m not sure how this would work with a credit card.

I know this is a gamble and not for the faint of heart. But I’ve heard stories of people using 0% cards strategically, and I’m wondering if this could be one of those situations… or just plain reckless given my current status.

**Any thoughts or advice?** Would love to hear from anyone who’s tried something similar.

Like month two, if there was no change, I would add another $50. If the money went down to say $45, I would have had to have added $55. If the account was at $57, I would have added $53.

\--

Hey Reddit, quick sanity check needed on my post-crash thinking. I didnt sell at the peak like Buffet. But my sour-grapes thought is, at least i didnt incur cap-gains 15%, then I extended it thinking ok, so what if I use margin strategically and pretend its dry powder? (Robinhood margin is \~6%). Not worried about Margin call - i have other assets to liquidate to pay for margin calls, i want to **STAY invested**, hence this plan.

**Assumptions for this hypothesis:**  
\- market will recover in 3-5years.  
\- will keep dip buying slowly as the knife falls till midterm elections (nov 26).

**The Numbers:**

* Lets say Portfolio: Was $1M, now \~$750k (down 25%).
* Peak Unrealized Gain: \~$250k (if I had sold).

**Scenario 1: Selling Peak (The Road Not Taken)**

* Sell $1M, realize $250k gain.
* Pay \~15% long-term cap gains tax = **$37,500**.
* Net cash proceeds = $962,500.

**Scenario 2: Stay Invested + Margin (The Current Plan)**

* Current position: $750k (no tax paid).
* Plan: Add **$100k-200k via margin @ 5%-6%** annual interest over 2 years (5-10k a month).
* Hold time assumption: **3 years**.

**The Trade-Off / My Logic:**

Is avoiding a definite **$37.5k tax hit** (by not selling) worth using **$200k margin** now, which costs **\~$30k-$36k in interest** over 3 years (5% of $200k \* 3)?

**Break-Even Point:**

* To make holding + margin ""better"" than selling + paying tax, my gains need to cover the avoided tax plus the margin interest.
* Target gain needed = $37.5k (tax) + $30k (interest) = **\~$67.5k**.
* That's roughly a **9% gain** on my original $750k over 3 years, *just to match* the cost comparison (doesn't include recovering the $250k loss).

Margin Sources:  
\- Robinhood at 5.75% for 3 years (limit 7m)  
\- 4% CC offers 50K for 12 months (will tap into this first as it has lower apr)

Is comparing the avoided tax ($37.5k) to margin interest ($36k) a cope or strategic? :) I get to STAY INVESTED in market, and pay 5% annual penalty for my inaction at peak.   
  
Example Portfolio $1M -> $750k (-25%). Didn't sell peak & realize $250k gain (would've paid $37.5k tax). Now thinking $200k margin @ 5% (\~$30k interest/3yr). Is avoiding $37.5k tax worth the $30k+ interest & risk of margin? Need \~9% gain just to cover that trade-off. Thats just 3% gain per year. Thoughts?

2025-04-06 17:34:53,"Thoughts on Investment Options Hi all,  
I am in my mid 30's have worked in the NYC school system for almost 10 years now. I have to contribute 6% of my salary to my pension plan, I voluntarily contribute 14% to an employee Tax Deferred Annuity program, and a Roth IRA (opened in 2020, just mutual funds). The goal is to be able to retire at or a little after 55. Some quick numbers...

Gross pay $9,400/month (I have several deductions in my paychecks like TDA/city tax/union fees....)

Pension: I'm not really sure how to explain this because it's a calculation of my final average salary x some other stuff, but it's a pension!

TDA balance: $107K (I contribute $1232/month; max contribution for the year is $23K)

Roth IRA: $10K (I contribute $1,200/year; max contribution is $7K)

My main question is **where should I be investing more of my money to?** Should I be putting more in my Roth/maxing it out and then putting more towards my TDA? I do plan on sitting with a financial advisor at some point this year, but the Reddit community is always so helpful with any inquires I've made in the past.

ASM in Australia, LEM (of which I am invested) and SCD in Canada, as well as a few projects in north, central and south, America who's names escape me. The various Greenland REE projects are also possible punts that might be good for a bubble play, but they have major hurdles to economic production, more so than the others IMHOP.  Most of the REE projects around the world have major hurdles but that's just where the industry is.

Please bare with me here because I’m not entirely sure how to phrase this question and this may be a bit rambley as a result. (Sorry if this seems simplistic to some people. I’m 23 and not exactly familiar with the stock market. I was just thrust into it in 2022 when I suddenly inherited a bunch of stocks but I didn’t really do much with it until relatively recently.)


So, I have an IRA investment account with Fidelity. I inherited it with a lot of money but mostly into individual stocks. Obviously, the US stock market is crashing right now, and investing into mutual funds which include companies that will be affected by the tariffs feels like not the best move for me personally. That is the prior info needed for my question. 

I guess basically what I’m trying to ask is, is it possible to invest in mutual funds within stock markets outside the US? Like, can I, as someone living in the US, use my Fidelity account to invest in a mutual fund that exclusively deals with companies that aren’t US based and won’t be affected by the tariffs directly? For example, could I access the London stock exchange? Would it be possible to use the money in my account for that? Or is my account somehow tied to the American market?

Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, just now gave George Stephanopoulos an example illustrating how tariffs could benefit consumers:

Kevin’s example:

• A small business (SMB) sells 100 apples at $1 per apple.

• Then, a 10% tariff is introduced.

• If the supplier raises prices, consumers purchase 10% fewer apples.

• Kevin explained, “So what is the small business going to do with these 10 apples? They don’t want to eat them, so they’ll lower the price.”

Implication:

The Trump administration expects the real burden of tariffs to fall on the small businesses themselves.

Unspoken consequence:

What Kevin Hassett did not mention is that the small business may go bankrupt, resulting in all of its employees being laid off.

as most people, I am in shock of the policies of this administration and I feel like we are certainly heading into a recession. I am posting to get some feedback and other people's opinion on my thought process. I, of course, don't have a crystal ball but I feel like many people are too relaxed as it somehow all worked out relatively problem free the last few dips/drops and people feel like they get the same company for a better price. I don't think that is the case as the E part of the P/E ratio will not be the same considering the changes in the supply chain and in consumer sentiment. Also, trust has been destroyed.

IF my thoughts are correct, big IF, I know, I think it would be rational to sit this out for a while even if I have to enter at higher prices when we have a reasonable economic policy or a reasonable president. I feel like this is not market timing. Market timing is, of course, difficult. It is just weighing current upside vs downside risk.

I have been very happy with my portfolio, it consists of companies that should all not be affected by tariffs in theory, but in practice, they unfortunately are as they will be sold off with everything else and also their earnings will drop in a general recession. Even V sold off.

2025-04-06 03:18:59,"To the ""line always goes up"" folks: why? The response I see most often is that this is based on population growth, especially in the US, since we have a very interesting lever other countries don't (or at least, not as much) which is immigration. Basically, open the doors a bit more, let in more folks, add more to the GDP, etc. I could get behind that, but I don't think it's a *given*. 

So if you believe in the ""always goes up eventually"" mantra, DCA right now, sure. But why is the fundamental assumption true for you? Or, is there another one I'm missing? 

I guess the pushback here is obvious, it's just a question of how likely you think it is: current policies become more restrictive/extended -> the US is no longer a desirable destination for economic immigrants -> population growth and GDP slows -> line doesn't always go up. I realize this is overly simplistic, but to me so is the assumption that we can sit back on population growth as assurance that eventually, the overall market always goes up and to the right. 

As I'm writing this, maybe one pushback to my pushback is that sure, this net influx may decrease, but the market for US goods abroad will still increase over time. Though that's worth challenging as well: several factors could impact global population rise and certainly global disposable income.

During this bear market, I am taking advantage of the opportunity and deploying $10k blocks every 5% down in the S&P below 10% down. Since we are at 17% down now, I am down to $80k in reserves.

My thesis is that the market will continue to go down significantly over the next few months to years but will eventually rebound.

I had been stockpiling cash since trumps election predicting some global destabilizing economic event would take place and now have a small lump sum ready to deploy. Because I think the market will go much further but eventually rebound I’ve set orders as a trailing stop purchase for XGRO by 3%, with the understanding that the purchase order won’t activate until the equity rises 3% below its lowest point. 

My thought process is that this will decrease the likely hood that I’ll purchase at far “too high” of a price in exchange for the fact that I’ll purchase at least 3% above the lowest point.

My wife and I have a good size post-tax portfolio in a basic three-fund allocation of ETFs (US stocks, international stocks, bonds). We also have a cash emergency fund and some money in cash equivalents (was earning great interest when rates were high). 

My wife has seen the carnage of the last two days and wants to sell our US stocks to hold more cash. She believes that none of this will get better in the next few years, and Trump's sledgehammer to the economy won't stop. 

I think selling when there's blood in the streets is a panic decision, and the stated purpose of our portfolio (long term wealth building) is unchanged. I think using some of our ""dry powder"" to buy during the Trump turmoil might work out well. 

She trusts the stock market very little, preferring tangible investments like real estate. I see it as one of the few viable roads to long term wealth (along with the house we own). 

I can't deny that echoes of Hawley-Smoot, the Great Depression, and the possibility of a constitutional crisis have me rattled too. I just don't want to make a snap, panic decision.

I use Betterment as my platform for basically everything—checking, HYSA, investing account, Roth IRA. I just happen to like it that way—keeps me invested on a regular basis for DCA purposes. I am 24 y/o and would like to continue investing on a recurring basis. Nevertheless they have TLH, but for my tax bracket which is 12% ($62K/yr salary), this recommendation to not turn TLH on appears:

“TLH+ is not usually beneficial for individuals in your federal tax bracket of 12%. Once TLH+ is turned on (1) Avoid trading in any of the ETFs in the Betterment portfolio in other accounts. (2) Turn it off if you plan on liquidating the majority of your taxable account in under a year. Be aware of your portfolio strategies. Electing different portfolio strategies for multiple goals may reduce opportunities for Tax Loss Harvesting.”

So because of my salary and 12% tax bracket, they do not recommend TLH. Do I abide by this or turn it on regardless? Is there harm to having TLH on for me specifically?

You then miraculously hold out until the current bottom of $5074 and decide to put your $100,000 back in, feeling like a genius. 

If the S and P 500 eventually recovers back to $6100, you made.... 20% extra return! Great. Let's not even consider potential dividends you missed out on by not being invested. 

That is $20 000 extra you made out with. Sounds like a lot, but really, it's not. You are not going to become a millionaire or be able to retire early off of a maneuvor like this. You need to CONTINUE with absolute perfect market timing to keep compounding these returns over time. Each time, you need to correctly time your SELL and also your BUY back in. 

The VAST majority of people cannot consistently do this and beat the benchmark over the long term. You might have a couple perfect trades, that give you some meager gains. But over the long term, you are going to mess up and miss time some HUGE gains by not being invested in the market.

This can't be farther from the truth.

To understand what's happening, we need to look at the government maturing debt in the next 30 years. 

An unusual load of debt must be refinanced just in the next few years during this administration.  

You would need two things to do that, (1) a load of cash, and (2) low interest rates. 

Slapping tariffs would do exactly that: (1) bringing a load of cash to the government, (2) causing the money in equity market to panic and escape to the treasuries which will cause the interest rates to drop.

Icing on the cake would be if Powell capitulates and lowers the funds rate ""because"" we might enter a recession.

As you can see, this is more of an emergency measure for a near term problem, something that has to be done if the country doesn't want to default and destroy the dollar.

So the thinking that the government is going to negotiate with China to remove the tariffs is completely flawed. The administration needs this money.

The mortgage rates are higher than a high yield savings, so seems like that is not an option.

I believe the market is in for a wild ride (downwards). I am not saying it will - nobody knows the future - but I sure did invest since a week, ahead of the tariff announcements, in uvxz and made quite a nice profit.
A bit nervous now about next week so I sold my complete position at the closing bell.
I believe next week will show the long term direction of the economy and if the tariff strategy might work (I give it a 10% chance, more if countries start to make “deals” with the US).  Any luck for other fellows? 🍀",,reddit/investing
2025-04-05 12:21:08,"Getting Defensive - What's your shield? Over the long term, I agree that constant DCA is the real strategy. But I was down 2 years' salary during the covid crash. I became increasingly concerned with capital protection because of all the supply chain issues and geopolitical tension. I looked around for something more conservative to ride out the uncertainty and I landed on the Permanent Portfolio. Sure, I missed out on some slight gains than if I had stayed 60/40, but the peace of mind was worth more.

I'm not saying to invest in the Permanent Portfolio necessarily, but I am using it as a shield during uncertainty and it has worked out well every single time. I switched from 60/40 to the PP before the election and gave myself 6 months to switch back to 60/40. Holy crap, I'm actually up quite a bit since November, '24 on account of gold skyrocketing. I still plan to return to 60/40 at the 6 month mark, but I think I'm down like 2% this past week. I sleep like a baby with this portfolio.

So, the point is. You can still stay invested and keep investing AND change your risk profile without outright changing your gameplan. This has nothing to do with timing the market, and more so having to do with keeping your risk at a comfortable level.",,reddit/investing

Fast forward a few years and now we are eerily following what happened back in early 20th century. 

The pandemic back then was also followed by high inflation, economic boom, over-levereged positions in the market, pumped up stocks etc. What followed was as a market crash, USA starting to impose tariffs and even a bigger market crash that led to the economic collapse.

2025-04-05 08:25:09,"DCA: How often are you buying the dip, and what proportion of your cash are you investing per DCA-investment? The financial advice most passive investors know now, is to DCA through the dip. Eventually when the economy recovers, we’d have bought into the market at a discount. But how often are you DCA-ing? Weekly? Monthly? Bi-monthly?

If you DCA too frequently, you will rack up transaction fees. And if the dip lasts longer than expected, you may run out of cash to continue DCA-ing before the dip hits its lowest.

If you DCA too infrequently though (maybe bi-monthly), then if the market somehow recovers within 2 months, you’d have missed the opportunity to buy the dip.

Looking at past market crashes and how long they took to recover may inform us of how often to schedule an investment, but they vary so much. 1929 great depression took 25 years to reach its ATH, 2000 dot com bubble took 15 years to reach its ATH, 2007 housing crisis took 4.5 years to reach its ATH, 2020 covid crash took 5 months to reach its ATH.

So, how are you guys planning to schedule your DCA, and how much are you investing per DCA investment, such that you can maximize your odds of having enough cash to continue investing at the lowest of lows?

2025-04-05 00:25:49,"Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era Elon Musk’s ventures have long dominated “space investing” conversations – but with Musk’s recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn’t publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \~$10–11B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn’t: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let’s break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:

* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab’s financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They’ve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .
* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab’s next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer – Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts. If successful, Neutron opens a much larger addressable market (national security launches, interplanetary missions, even crewed flights eventually). Investors are watching this closely; any positive development (engine tests, on-time construction) could boost the stock. In the meantime, Rocket Lab isn’t waiting around: they’ve signed new launch deals (e.g. an 8-launch contract with Japan’s iQPS just announced) , and they delivered on missions like launching 8 satellites for OroraTech with just 4 months’ turnaround , showcasing operational excellence.
* Government and Commercial Tailwinds: Unlike many space SPACs and startups that struggled, Rocket Lab has real customers and repeat business. Their backlog is \~$1.1B , split \~50/50 between government and commercial clients – providing diversification. Notably, Rocket Lab was selected for the U.S. Space Force’s NSSL Phase 3 (Lane 1) program , making them eligible for missions under a $5.6B launch contract umbrella alongside incumbents like SpaceX and ULA. They also hold a $515M contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to build missile-tracking satellite systems . These wins not only validate Rocket Lab’s technology in the eyes of key customers, but also ensure a baseline of revenue in coming years. In essence, Rocket Lab is aligning itself as a core player in future government space infrastructure – a recurring revenue stream that many “new space” companies lack.
* Musk Factor – or Lack Thereof: From an investing standpoint, one could argue that Musk has become a risk factor. Tesla’s own 10-K warned that the brand is tied to Musk’s reputation , and indeed we’ve seen political backlash contribute to Tesla’s sales slump and stock drop . SpaceX, while successful, is privately funded and also influenced by Musk’s persona (which might carry regulatory or public image risks, given his role in government and polarizing public statements). Rocket Lab provides a “Musk-free” exposure to the space sector. CEO Peter Beck is an engineer-executive who keeps a lower profile. There’s no cult of personality driving Rocket Lab’s valuation – which means less idiosyncratic risk. In fact, Rocket Lab’s shares are more directly correlated with its execution (launch success, contracts, revenue) than with any social media narrative. For an investor, that can be reassuring.

Valuation Considerations: After the recent pullback, RKLB trades at a more reasonable multiple relative to its growth. It had skyrocketed over 400% in the past year , but is now off highs. Analysts still see upside: Cantor Fitzgerald recently reaffirmed an Overweight with a $24 target , and other targets range up to $33 . Clearly, expectations are that Rocket Lab will continue to scale and eventually approach profitability as Neutron comes into service. Risks include execution delays (a short-seller argued Neutron could be late to 2026 , which would slow revenue growth) and competition (SpaceX’s dominance, emerging players like Blue Origin). However, Rocket Lab’s head start in small launch and established customer base give it a moat in its niche. Its enterprise value ($11B) is a fraction of SpaceX’s ($140B private valuation), so investors are essentially betting that Rocket Lab can capture even a small slice of SpaceX’s market share in the coming years – which would justify significant upside.

Conclusion: If you’re disillusioned with Musk or simply want a piece of the space sector’s growth, Rocket Lab is one of the most compelling options available. It combines the innovation of New Space with the accountability of a public company. As always, invest based on your due diligence (space is a risky industry), but RKLB offers a balanced risk-reward profile: solid current business, big future bets, and freedom from the Elon factor. For many, that’s an attractive proposition in 2025 and beyond.

Historically, when the VIX exceeds 25, it often signals prime buying opportunities. In fact, every instance of the VIX surpassing this threshold has been followed by significant market rebounds.

All the negative factors projected tariffs, absence of deals, and lack of tax cuts are currently being priced into the market. None of these have materialized yet. Similarly, no positive developments have occurred, except for the trillions of investments flowing into our country. Any hint of a deal or policy shift could ignite a strong rally.

I’m no market oracle, so I’m taking a measured approach by DCA into positions. And anyone here who claims to be one is mistaken because the future is uncertain. Notably, two prominent hedge fund managers initiated new positions in NVDA today. Why? Because, despite the unpredictability of policy decisions, they recognize the value in NVDA at $100. Reflecting on 2022, we experienced several dead cat bounces until the bottom was reached in October.

Reviewing my purchases from 2022: ￼
	•	1/24: 50 shares at $393
	•	2/4: 10 shares at $409
	•	3/8: 5 shares at $383
	•	5/23: 20 shares at $360
	•	8/2: 5 shares at $374
	•	9/13: 10 shares at $361
	•	10/17: 10 shares at $335
	•	12/7: 4 shares at $361

As you can see, I was down pretty bad all year but remained consistent. I own four ETFs, and even if this market declines another 90%, I will still be okay.

Remember, the best opportunities often arise when fear peaks. While others hesitate, this could be the moment to consider buying. Markets have a history of rebounding, and those who act decisively during downturns often reap the rewards.",,reddit/investing

2025-04-04 20:33:36,"Stock market today: Dow plunges 2,200 points, Nasdaq enters bear market as Trump tariffs spark worst meltdown since 2020 US stocks cratered on Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plunging more than 2,200 points after China stoked trade-war fears and Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of higher inflation and slower growth stemming from tariffs.

The Dow pulled back 5.5% to enter into correction territory. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (GSPC) sank nearly 6%, as the broad-based benchmark capped its worst week since 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 5.8% to close in bear market territory.

The major averages added to Thursday's $2.5 trillion wipeout after China said it will impose additional tariffs of 34% on all US products from April 10 — matching the extra 34% duties imposed by Trump on Wednesday.

That ramped up investor worries that countries are more likely to retaliate than negotiate, leading to a protracted global trade war.

Investors flocked to government bonds as the 10-year Treasury (TNX) yield fell to 3.9%, nearing its lowest levels since October.

Economists are warning that with tariffs as-is, the risk of a US recession is rising. The monthly jobs report, unusually overshadowed Friday, showed a labor market that held steady ahead of Trump's biggest tariffs. The US added 228,000 jobs in March, beating estimates, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%.

Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Powell for the first time addressed the reality of the tariffs, saying they were ""higher than anticipated."" He said it is ""too soon to say"" what the proper rate path should be. Traders have ramped up bets on interest rate cuts this year to five, as the Fed is expected to set its efforts to cool inflation aside to tackle the bigger risk of economic slowdown.

Trump, posting on Truth Social on Friday, added to fears by saying that his policies ""will never change"" and warning that China ""played it wrong.""

2025-04-04 18:37:24,"Tariffs & Tesla- Will the hit affect sentiment around Tesla? And are you a goldfish? I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, just move on. 

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain. 

Here is a great interview with the well respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those with short attention spans, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".
2. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends. 
3. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*  
4. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.
5. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession. 
6. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us). 
7. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the ""little guy"" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices. 
8. America is a consumer-based economy (\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is ""no tomorrow"". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.
9. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).
10. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business has very long time cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.
11. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.
12. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. 
13. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is ""half done"" in his view. 

One thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administrations haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.

\*I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more ""TLDR"" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out, as far more likely to be of great benefit China in both the near term and long run. Not America.

Back to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a ""possibility"" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:

6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR)

While the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from it's recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the ""Trump Bump"" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and ""meh"" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen an *real* damage to it's share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon! 

I know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: ""*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. He is going to build a car in 5-seconds. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*"" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. Fact: It is physically impossible to build an entire car in 5-seconds because of physics (Newton's Second Law applies here: F=ma). It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as ""Tesler"". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF).

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised voters that he would do. He will have to pick between his voters and Elon soon enough. 

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.   

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the most rosy picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself). But if there is real lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers, Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future, boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.  

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow. 

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost- and counting. While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a bandaid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time. 

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla. 

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

\- Price increases on products, resulting in consumers cutting back on purchases

\- Companies are selling fewer products, resulting in a lowered top line

\- The rest of the world completely changing their trading approaches with US, resulting in more isolation and, again, a decrease in sales and revenues.

Could company prices at 30-40% below recent highs be the new norm, at least for 5-10 years? Even if there is a change in administration in 4 years, I believe it would be too late for a quick recovery to the levels of sales and revenue that we had last quarter. ",,reddit/investing

I realize time in the market is the leading recommendation than timing the market with investing. 

The crap that’s happening is pretty ridiculous! Don’t get me started on the current Administration policies! I also realize that this downturn is definitely not as bad as the previous downturns, YET! 

However, this has the potential of being up there with the worst downturns pretty soon if this continues! I know my numbers will pale in comparison to many others that have 6 or 7 digit losses in the last 1 month. 

I have read countless posts, articles, and books about how time in the market is better than timing the market. So, it’s been drilled into my brain to stick out the bad times because it will turn around. 

It is so frustrating right now (I know I know I’m not the only one). I have lost over 35k in the past month (once again I know that’s Pennies for some folks). However, it took 3 years to gain that 35k only to be wiped out in 1 month!! It is really hard to see those losses so quickly! 

It’s so hard to get over the fact that; what if I had sold everything a month ago and weathered the storm on the sidelines?

Also, here is a great question/observation: what is the core/simplest reason why the market is dumping? 

Answer: a ton of folks/institutions are SELLING! So, why is it so ingrained that time in the market is better than timing the market. If that was the case, we wouldn’t see these drastic selloffs, right? It seems like not many folks are following this consensus!

The main factor that could affect my profits would be the Euro/usd exchange rate changing drastically in the future. 

I'm a first time investor. Are there any gotchas or potential stumbling blocks I'm not aware of by investing in a Euro-listed ETF rather than a USD-listed ETF? I don't expect to ever live in an EU country or use Euros in the future.

2025-04-04 01:29:43,"With a $5 trillion increase in deficits from tax cuts who is going to buy US treasuries abroad in a tariff war? Are we risking the Dollar global reserve currency status on tariffs? Peter Thiel has long been saying globalism was bad in the Clinton era fueling growth in a bad way. To what extent sure, I dont agree with everything Clinton did at the behest of the GOP Senate and House. But sometimes once you do something there is no going back.

Corporations are already flatly saying they cannot (will not) build the infrastructure and find the labor pool to do what the mega manufacturing cities of China and other Asian countries can do even if you tariffed them 1000%.

Thiel (especially for an immigrant) seems fixated on bringing us back to the 1960s, I suggest watching any of his interviews over the last 10 years he says the same every ime any way. He wants innovation in industry and jets for some reason (he always talks about the flight time to London). And, he says it will be bad for a big percentage of the population. At least he doesnt lie about it, a generation or two are gonna get sent to the cleaners.

Who buys american debt in this scenario? Banks wont touch it. Internationals wont touch it, With the tariffs completely screwing up FX and countries use of treasuries to make trade work. Whos buying treasuries when your gonna get smoked on your 4% 10 year when it goes to 1981 18% again?

Please explain how we are not witnessing, unless some rabbit is pulled out of a hat, the death of America Global Capitalism?

edit: for those who dont know Peter Thiel is the billionaire tech investor who is alt right. He funded JD Vances campaigns and employed him at his VC for a non-job, just a fake rubber stamp when JD says hes from VC its bullshit.

edit: Trump also saying today tariffs worked in 1700-1800s lol. America was a back country, poor relative to Europe, barely regional power even in the late 1800s. We want to go back to that? We doing the cotton gin again to make clothes? We got rid of tariffs in 1918 or something so we could income tax the robber barons

2025-04-04 01:26:10,"The UN Is Mispricing Demographic Risk in China—Global Macro Investors Should Pay Attention **TL;DR**: The UN projects China’s population decline will be moderate with fertility rebounding over time. But that assumption isn't based on evidence—it's baked into the model itself.  The UN’s “median case” is deeply flawed and the ""Constant Fertility"" and ""80% lower bound series better reflect reality. Given these assumptions, we’re looking at hundreds of millions lost within decades—and potentially up to a billion fewer people by 2100.

# 1. The “Fertility Rebound” Is a Modeling Mirage

The UN assumes global convergence to \~1.8 TFR (total fertility rate), so even countries in freefall are forecast to recover. Not because of policy success, but because the model expects them to.

* China 2025 TFR: 1.02 --> UN 2100 forecast: 1.35

The UN uses a Bayesian framework that tends to average things out. So this forecast isn’t optimized for China’s data, but influenced on a broader, globalized assumption set.

# 2. Marriage Is Collapsing—And Births Will Likely Follow

[In 2024, Chinese marriage registrations fell by 20.5%](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/10/china/china-marriage-registrations-record-low-2024-intl-hnk/index.html)—continuing a long-term decline and hitting the lowest level ever recorded. This is a leading indicator for birth rates.

* **96%** of births in China occur within marriage
* Fewer mariages = Fewer babies

# 3. Urbanization Is Driving Fertility Even Lower

China’s urbanization was 65% in 2023, and is projected exceed 80% by 2050. Fertility in major cities is already very low:

* **Shanghai**: 0.70
* **Beijing**: 0.75

As more people move to cities, the national average is more likely to fall than rise.

# 4. Comparable East Asian societies have even lower rates—and they're still declining.

TFR today:

* **Hong Kong**: 0.77
* **Taiwan**: 0.87
* **Singapore (ethnic Chinese)**: 0.94
* **South Korea**: 0.72 (world’s lowest)
* **Japan**: 1.26 (still falling)

# 5. Pro-Natal Policy Is Largely Ineffective

* [South Korea spent $200B+ since 2006 on fertility incentives.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-04/asia-spending-millions-to-reverse-declining-fertility-rates/103779994) TFR: still 0.72
* Japan has offered child allowances, subsidized care, paid parental leave for 20+ years.

Despite pro-natalist policies, birth rates continue to decline in Japan, South Korea, and across much of Europe.

# 6. The UN Keeps Revising Down

* **2019 UN forecast**: China peaks 2031–2035
* **Actual peak**: 2022
* **2024 revision**: The “base case” is now below the 2022 low-end scenario

**Final Thought**:  
In my opinion, the UN’s 2024 forecast appears to be systemically flawed and I believe their 2026 forecast will be further revised down. I don't claim to have a crystal ball but I think it's worth drawing attention to these figures which are significantly worse than what has been widely reported.

Note: I'm not an economist, statistician or a demographer so take my analysis with a grain of salt.

95 years ago the US levied the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, worldwide tariffs that were designed to encourage domestic production and punish ""cheating countries"". This kicked off a trade war that had no small part in causing a world-wide depression. 

The US has not levied global tariffs of this degree since then. Until yesterday.

What happened to US equities?  After a roaring bull run during which wealth was printed and the every-day man flung money in the market it crashed. But not overnight. In fits and starts the DJI lost 90% of its value over a 3 year period. 

It took *25* years for it to return to an ATH. 

Trump has fired 10s of thousands of federal employees. He's spiking unemployment. He's taxing imports to the tune of 50-100%. Other countries will do the same to us. Our companies will start having mass layoffs, crushing economic activity and investment. Domestic production will not return, everyone one will be out of money to buy stuff anyways. The SH tariffs did nothing to encourage domestic manufacturing, it just made everyone poorer.

I’m as basic as it gets as far as investing goes. I have a 401k that I’m contributing to at the max level matched by my employer, which is about what I can feasibly afford to set aside. Up until this point I’ve been incredibly hands-off, allowing my contributions to go into a targeted fund which is currently heavily weighted in stocks as I’m still a ways off from retirement.

I generally agree with the overwhelming consensus of this sub that says to not try to time the market and just ignore the news, keep plugging away through the ups and downs yada yada because nobody can truly predict the market.

However (and here’s where I’m sure I’ll be mocked and downvoted), it seems like that conventional wisdom was established *before* we had a president who would do things like announce that he’s going to tank the US stock market on a specific date. That feels like a key factor worth making a small exception to the conventional wisdom, does it not?

Yesterday, I simply moved my current holdings from the targeted fund, into short term bonds (75%) and a money market fund (25%). I’m not married to any of these percentages, that’s just what felt right based on my very limited knowledge. Please chime in if you have a better suggestion. Most importantly, my future contributions will continue to go into the targeted fund buying up these increasingly cheap shares. I’m not running away, I’m just trying to preserve what I’ve already accumulated in the face of certain destruction. 

Now, obviously timing the drop was the easy part, they announced it. And I don’t have near the hubris to think I’ll be able to accurately predict where the bottom is. But I don’t really need to do I? As long as I move everything back in at some point between now and when the market eventually rallies above the position I sold at yesterday, I’ll have ended with more shares than I would have had I just ridden it out. Hell, I could move everything back in right now and I would be *slightly* better off. 

I’m still mulling over how to proceed having mostly avoided this initial drop. I’m thinking of maybe moving it back in 10% at a time over the next few weeks or months rather than try to choose one “ideal” moment. Open to suggestions there. Yes, I know it’s a long game and moves like this are somewhat trivial in the grand scheme of a 30+ year retirement fund but still…Ignoring a blatant certainty that the market is going to tank on a specific day when there are very simple ways to minimize my exposure, just seemed unnecessarily rigid.

2025-04-03 20:16:12,"AEC Group needs better strategies to ride on new productive force By Peter Chan, Unicorn Analytics

Allied Sustainability and Environmental Consultants Group Limited (“AEC Group”; HKEx stock code: 8320), with rich resources and business connections accumulated since its establishment in 1994, stands a good chance to benefit from opportunities afforded by the new productive force (the “NPF”) trend emerged in recent years. Listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2016, AEC Group focuses on sustainability advisory, environmental impact assessments, energy efficiency solutions, and green building certifications. Though with a long history by Hong Kong’s standards, AEC Group is still a relatively small player in its own turfs. Its pathways towards riding on the NPF trend rest on how it capitalizes on its edges in the industry and connections unavailable to bigger peers.

NPF has been emerging as a forward-looking economic framework gaining traction, particularly in China, emphasizing innovation as the engine of growth. It strives to integrate advanced technologies, namely thought digitalization, artificial intelligence, and green solutions, into different industries to drive high-quality, sustainable development. Key sectors under the NPF banner include renewable energy, smart manufacturing, new materials, and environmental technologies, all underpinned by a global push toward carbon neutrality and resource efficiency.

For AEC Group, whose businesses revolve around environmental consultancy and stewardship, the NPF trend, on face value, presents a good trigger to expand its footprint. Yet successes hinge on how well the Group the opportunities and hurdles effectively.

AEC Group’s service offerings are in good alignment with NPF’s green ethos. As governments and corporations worldwide prioritize sustainability, demand for services like environmental audits and green certifications is surging. The Hong Kong Government’s pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 is a precursor for spurring projects in energy-efficient buildings, low-carbon transport, and renewable energy adoption. On paper, AEC Group’s experience positions it advantageously in guiding clients through this transition, in commissions including providing certifications to high-rise buildings as eco-friendly or optimizing energy use for various workplaces.

In Mainland China, meanwhile, the country’s ""dual carbon"" goals, peaking emissions by 2030 and achieving neutrality by 2060, are complemented by Hong Kong’s Climate Action Blueprint 2050. These government-led commitments translate into tangible demand for expertise in carbon accounting, emissions reduction strategies, and compliance reporting. With its memberships in top professional bodies in the environmental protection field, AEC Group is well-positioned to be a go-to partner for businesses navigating these regulations, especially as carbon markets mature in the Greater Bay Area and beyond.

The NPF trend exacts pressure for small and medium enterprises operating in the region to go green. Comprising majority of the region’s corporate demographics, given their budget constraints and discreet customization needs, SMEs tend to commission their NPF adaptation works to smaller service providers they can rely on. AEC Group stands a good chance to fill this market vacuum with affordable, practical solutions, such as energy-saving audits or sustainability reports tailored to smaller budgets, thereby unlocking a steady stream of clients eager to meet new standards without their means. The wins in Macau and the expansion into Malaysia in 2023 were good examples.

Yet the bigger peers such as AECOM and ARUP are also looking into capturing shares in this new NPF trend. AEC Group needs to highlight its niche in provision of highly customized services, such as advising on carbon credit trading or integrating smart technologies into building designs to create a distinct identity that sets it apart from the competition.

AEC Group also needs a deep dive into pushing boundaries in its consulting game plan. It needs to indulge in cutting-edge tools, such as using artificial intelligence to crunch environmental data for sharper insights, or blockchain to track carbon emissions with transparency, innovations that elevate its services from standard to standout.

Nonetheless, AEC Group’s modest profitability, having turned around just a bit for the year to March 2024, might limit its capacity to chase major projects or invest more reasonably in. Its growth might hinge on strategic alliances, such as partnering with technology firms to co-develop green solutions, or to secure funding to scale operations and compete for bigger contracts.

With its service offerings and industry connections, AEC Group could offer clear, actionable carbon footprint assessments and reduction plans, positioning itself as a key player in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area’s emerging carbon trading markets. As far as smart green buildings are concerned, AEC Group could integrate accessible technologies like Internet-of-things sensors for provision of energy management services to assist green transition of buildings.",,reddit/investing

So i saw that visa is trying to take over Mastercards operations with Apple card and planned to wait to see if they get it as itll most likely be a great boost to their stock price, then when it gets high enough unplanned on selling my shares and reinvest in other stocks. But the recent announcement of the tariffs has caused the price to plummet quite a bit so I'm concerned that even if they do get the deal, it continue to drop.

2025-04-03 18:50:58,"Is it wise to be investing international right now? With Trump’s tariffs, it’s my understand these won’t just hurt the US economy but also the broader world economy. 

Due to this and other Trump policies that have alienated many of our allies, I’ve been concerned the US economy, and even the World economy, might go into a recession. Even if there is a recovery, perhaps the world won’t welcome us back with open arms after the way the Trump administration has talked to and about our European allies, as well as the tariffs, leaving the US economy weaker, isolated, and more vulnerable.

Many of our “exports” are services which is precisely why American companies like Apple and Microsoft have done so well. Manufacturing, even if brought back, might not benefit the US economy the way it did the in the past. You can’t roll the clock back. The logistics alone of actually building new manufacturing facilities in the US, training and hiring workers, this all takes YEARS, even decades. One of the markers of an advanced economy is that service jobs make up a larger share of the market than manufacturing jobs. 

To prepare, I’ve wondered if I should either stop contributions to my IRA, or contribute to international index funds like EFAX (only developed economies) or even XLP since consumer staples tend to do better during recessions?",,reddit/investing

Canadian investor here.  
So, i have a modest 82k CAD portfolio which is down to 70k (-15%). No money left to DCA more. Its a mix of top MAG7 stocks except Tesla.  
It hurts very bad and kind of want me to just close everything and run away. But cannot help myself opening my app and seeing it every 10mins. 

I know its long term, wouldn't make a difference after a year or 2 years. I get all that.  
  
Just wanted to check, how are you guys dealing with this urge or pain to see your portfolio down so much? What do you do exactly to keep your mind away from these apps, or tradingview charts, news, etc. ?

2025-04-03 16:46:00,"Where are we in the emotional stock market cycle (not today, but overall)? If you're a strict ""buy-and-hold"" or DCA investor, please disregard the following because it probably doesn't apply to you, but I long ago saw (don't recall where) a model for how investors respond ***emotionally*** (as opposed to *rationally*) to the market cycle.

Setting aside any objective views of whether we think stocks currently should be either 1) poised for a recovery or 2) on the verge of further losses, I'd be curious to hear how others view where we are in the emotional cycle right now. For example, you might think we're worried or panic stricken or even that (overall), we're already in some stage of rebuilding.

I'll save my thoughts about it for now. However, for perspective, I'd say that the buildup to the [dot.com](http://dot.com) crash was the clearest example I've ever seen of ""Euphoric."" In fact, it clearly was off the charts into irrational exuberance.

Where are we right now?

* Cautious (First Stage of Rebuilding)
* Hopeful
* Positive
* Confident
* Thrilled
* Euphoric (Top)
* Surprised (First Stage of Decline)
* Nervous
* Worried
* Panic Stricken
* Defeated (Bottom)

EDIT: In case it's not obvious, I could add that you don't necessarily reach the top or bottom in every cycle.

However, when you're reaching market highs, you're by definition somewhere between Confident and Euphoric, I'd think.

Conversely, you could have a downturn that doesn't necessarily reach Defeated. It does happen, however.",,reddit/investing

I knew that the people around him in Admin 2.0 was drastically different than Admin 1.0.  I decided to take 🥭 at his word while everyone else “hoped” for the best.  Hope is not a strategy and today it showed.

I knew that even 10% tariffs across the board would be devastating for company earnings.  The fact the tariffs came in that much worse was just extra gravy for my hedged portfolio.

I used puts mostly but also had calls on GLD, IBIT, NVDA and OKLO as a partial hedge to my short positions.

I’m still heavily net short as I anticipate retaliatory tariffs will be applied by other countries.  I expect these headlines to drop intermittently over the next few weeks so I think upside for the major indices is effectively capped at maybe 3-5%.

2025-04-03 11:31:07,"[DD] How to Profit Off the Trade War [$500k invested] Hello everyone,

This morning, I wanted to discuss the implications of the trade war for your investment strategies. I get the sense that many of you are misunderstanding what is happening right now. Retail investors consider this to be the beginning of a bear market. But they don’t realize that a bear market in one sector can mean tremendous opportunity in another. Institutional investors consider this to be the beginning of a major sector rotation into a sector that has been massively undervalued and neglected: American industry, energy, and materials. I am going to explain how you can come to understand all of this as an opportunity.

Those that follow my last few posts on mining, infrastructure, energy transitions (e.g. [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/) and, most recently, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1j42h15/blackrock_made_a_move_on_panama_ports_theyre/))  know that I have been anticipating continued actions (including steep tariffs) by the present administration to combat Chinese influence over critical mineral and metal supply chains. My entire portfolio has more-or-less been restructured from the beginning of the  term with this background assumption in mind. My research over the last months has focused on understanding which companies stand to benefit from increased import/export controls. Again, my emphasis is on domestic metals, minerals, and mining specifically.

**I. Context Setting**

My thesis remains fundamentally unchanged. It is as follows:

>**Thesis/Summary:** the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present US administration and hopefully beyond. The investments that will matter most have to do with the processing, extraction, separation, and manufacturing of titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals deemed critical. These investments must be allied with western interests, ideally operating in the United States. The issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance China has over these metals and rare earth minerals. 

In the past, I have supported this position by examining the present administration’s executive orders, legislative agenda, as well as conducting an analysis of major hedge fund and institutional holdings beginning 2024 Q4. In this post, I will instead point out the general features of my most treasured investments which have earned them the right to exist in my portfolio. 

As I explained previously, my methodology for investment decisions have been guided by the following principles:

1. First, priority should be given to domestic companies looking to mine, refine, and develop critical metals/minerals in the USA or who may be substantial suppliers of our critical minerals stockpile. Secondary priority should be given to those companies part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and/or within Canada, and wishing to mine, refine, or develop critical metals/minerals in the USA, or who may be stockpile suppliers.
2. Priority should be given to companies that have substantial federal contracts already or have projects presently awaiting government permits, funding, or regulative actions, where such action would be expressly in the USA national security interest.
3. Priority should be given to companies that have institutionally and politically well-resourced members involved in their board, leadership, governing body.
4. Priority should be given to companies represented unusually strongly in the portfolio of major hedge funds, have unusual levels of insider activity, and/or are represented in the financial disclosures of politicians in Washington, D.C.
5. Priority should be given to companies that have established they can deliver results or who have a head start in their particular niche of the industry relative to competitors.

It should be rather straightforward to see how it is, exactly, that these considerations could lead one to investment strategies that will be shielded from international export/import controls. 

Let me run you through one example of an investment choice I have made that has aligned with the considerations above: **MP Materials.** The company is entirely focused on the domestic US supply chain for rare earths and minerals critical to national security, energy, transportation, technology, and so on. They are also the *only* company in the entire US that is vertically integrated: able to not only mine materials, but also to refine and process them, etc.

They have massive [federal funding contracts](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2941793/dod-awards-35-million-to-mp-materials-to-build-us-heavy-rare-earth-separation-c/), their CEO is extremely well-connected, institutional holdings increased massively in Q4 2024 ([Blackrock took a 10% stake;](https://fintel.io/i/blackrock) Australia’s richest woman, Gina Rinehart, who is a close friend and supporter[ of Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/gina-rinehart-anthony-pratty-donald-trump-us-newspaper-ads-inauguration), took a 9% stake in the company through her investment fund, Hancock Prospecting).  In addition to all of this, MP has [scaled quickl](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx)y in both their early supply chain (mining-side) sector, as well as mid-stream, having recently begun operations of a new refining facility in TX. 

In my view, MP has the domestic side of this sector backed into the corner. It’s not even close.

**II. Positions Explained**

What are the rest of my positions? It is a mixture of stock/equity and delta-focused derivatives (I only hold calls, not puts). I love leveraged positions, generally. Anyways, here are my holdings, though they do not include my HSA investments. You can ignore RDDT, UPS, AMZN. Those are unrelated.

https://preview.redd.it/o0c05nyavlse1.png?width=595&format=png&auto=webp&s=2159440c55fbec7f9dbae8c9eebe2bd08f81af39

Briefly, here are few of what I consider my top holdings and what they do:

1. MP: Heavy Rare Earth Mining, Processing, Magnets
2. UUUU: Uranium and Titanium
3. LAC: Lithium/batteries
4. ABAT: Lithium Battery & Recycling
5. VAL: Deepsea mining infrastructure.

I know this is a scary time for a lot of people. Please do take a breath and consider how you think the next few years will unfold, carefully. I hope my post is useful to some of you and I welcome further thoughts on investment strategies in this brave new world.

2025-04-03 11:09:07,"$100 put spreads into $9,400 gain Pin risk worked in my favor this time I guess.

I bought these put spreads before close, then when I saw SPY was around $551 after trump pulled out his tariff bingo card, I called my brokerage to exercise the 559 puts. 

They told me on the phone it was possible the other party would not exercise their $558 puts. I thought yeah right, they're like $9 ITM but okay whatever I'll take the risk.

Actually can't believe that I woke up and was short 700 shares of SPY.

2025-04-03 10:49:39,"The most important move in the markets right now in my opinion is... the US dollar index (ticker $DXY). It's down around 2% right now in the premarket:

What does this mean? To me this likely means foreign investors are pulling out of US markets because of all of the uncertainty related to tariffs. Note that imports become even more expensive when the dollar weakens. One thing to keep in mind however is that the US dollar index is still at a normal level historically speaking:

https://preview.redd.it/jt2kam9pnlse1.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd17ff410e78d980037baf8d5b97ea25751929b

As you can see, the US dollar index has bounced off the $100 level over the past few years multiple times. A big reason for this is because the dollar rises when the Fed raises rates. However the Fed can't realistically raise rates at the moment without tipping the US into a recession, so I don't know how much they can do to support the dollar if it falls below $100.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

I think everyone seems to be forgetting that big tech will begin facing budget constraints due to tariffs which will slow down their AI investments until the Ai sector figures out how to shift production components away from china.

It’s likely big tech customers (who make up a big chunk of AI revenue) will find ways to make supply chain adjustments so that they don’t fall behind to their competitors…but this adjustment period will significantly cause delays and potential slow down in order volumes from chip and data centers as companies figure out  how to reduce exposure to tariffs(in the short term).

Historical Bear Market Percentages: 

 * Average Decline: The average bear market sees a decline of around 35%. However, this can range from just over 20% to nearly 90%.
 * Smallest Decline: Some bear markets have had relatively small percentage declines, such as the one in July 1990 which saw a drop of approximately 19.9%.
 * Largest Decline: The most severe bear market on record was during the Great Depression, where the S&P 500 plummeted by approximately 83% between 1929 and 1932. Other significant declines include the bear markets of 1973-1974 (-48.2%) and 2007-2009 (-56.8%).
Historical Bear Market Durations:
 * Average Duration: The average bear market lasts about 15 months. However, durations have ranged from a few weeks to several years.
 * Shortest Bear Market: The shortest bear market occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lasting only 33 days.
 * Longest Bear Market: The longest bear market coincided with the Great Depression, spanning from 1929 to 1932, a period of almost 3 years. Other lengthy bear markets include the one from 2000-2002 (31 months) and 1973-1974 (21 months).

The European Union is preparing to retaliate against the introduction of new duties by the Donald Trump administration, which will come into force on April 2.

Brussels is considering the possibility of using a full arsenal of measures, including restricting the access of American companies to the European market and public tenders. This was reported by a source of El País in the EU.

The new US customs tariffs, which Trump calls ""reciprocal,"" could seriously affect trade relations between the two sides of the Atlantic.

According to the US administration, the annual volume of imports and exports between the US and the EU reaches 900 billion euros, with a trade balance of 235.5 billion euros in favor of Europe.

In response, the European Commission is considering tough measures, including imposing tariffs on American goods, restricting access to European financial markets, and even banning American companies from participating in EU-funded projects.

At the same time, European capitals, including France, Italy, and Ireland, are calling for a cautious approach to avoid a full-blown trade war.

Despite the escalating situation, Brussels continues to try to negotiate with Washington. The EU is even offering some concessions, including lower duties on industrial goods and increased purchases of American liquefied natural gas.

However, if the US does not abandon the new customs restrictions, Europe is ready to act without red lines.

(Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering revoking tariff exemptions for low-value shipments from China, known as ""de minimis,"" as part of Wednesday's tariff announcement, a source familiar with the plans said.

The de minimis rule allows goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without tariffs, a loophole that has benefited Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. Revoking this exemption would align with broader efforts to counter China's trade practices and strengthen U.S. manufacturing.

The tariff measures, set to be announced Wednesday, include a 25% tariff on automobile imports beginning April 3, with additional duties on auto parts expected to follow. The administration argues that these tariffs will help protect domestic industries and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers.

""We are taking strong action to ensure American businesses compete on a level playing field,"" a senior White House official said.

However, critics warn that these moves could have unintended consequences. Some economists estimate that tariffs could increase costs for American consumers, with one analysis suggesting that U.S. households could pay an additional $3,400 annually. Trading partners, including the European Union, have expressed concern, with some considering retaliatory tariffs that could further strain global trade relations.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-04-02 15:55:43,"Rivian posts sharp fall in quarterly deliveries as soft demand weighs (Reuters) - Rivian reported a 36% decline in first-quarter deliveries on Wednesday, as the electric-vehicle maker grapples with weak demand, sending its shares down nearly 6%.

EV makers have been battling tough demand as consumers opt for cheaper hybrid and gas-powered vehicles in an uncertain economic and political environment.

""I would say the sector at the moment is out of favor. Over the medium to long term, EVs are still inevitable, and so it's just going to take some time for these companies to continue to ramp up,"" said Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough had said in February vehicle deliveries would be lower this year due to soft demand, partially because of the impact of fires in Los Angeles.

Demand could be further pressured as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are expected to accelerate inflation and increase prices of automobiles, making consumers wary of committing to big purchases.

Sheppard said Rivian's margins would be affected by tariffs, and it could face a larger hit from the duties as opposed to bigger players such as Tesla.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe had said earlier this year the company expects higher costs from tariffs on Mexico and Canada as it has a supply chain footprint in these countries.

The company delivered 8,640 vehicles in the quarter ended March 31, down from 13,588 a year earlier. But the deliveries exceeded analysts' estimate of 8,200, according to Visible Alpha.

Tesla reported a 13% slump in quarterly sales, its weakest performance in nearly three years, as backlash to CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics grows and consumers seek out newer models from rival EV makers.

Rivian produced 14,611 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 13,980 a year ago. It reaffirmed its annual deliveries forecast.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

CoreWeave / $CRWV is a Nvidia-backed cloud AI services provider. $CRWV is one of the first pure-play AI IPOs, offering AI technology in the cloud. It's backers: Nvidia, Fidelity, and Magnetar. Nvidia even anchored the IPO with a $250 million order. 

Financials: CoreWeave raised $1.5 billion in its IPO, the most for a U.S. tech offering since 2021. Revenue last year was $1.92 billion, up 737% from the year before. Growth is undeniable, but there's also a net loss of $863 million reported last year. (D'uh).

Strong Customer Base: Microsoft, Meta, IBM, and Cohere are all customers. Microsoft alone accounts for 62% of CoreWeave's revenue.

The IPO priced below the expected range, opening at $39 and closing at $40. Friday was a shitty day (-3% nasdaq) to IPO.

So, what's the play?

This isn't a short-term YOLO imho, IV is so high it's only good for writing puts. Shares for me, but you do you. Also do your own DD, obviously. Current market price is still kinda close to IPO range.

2025-04-02 07:39:20,"NVDA and ""Liberation Day"" NVDA and Tariff Day

This thesis serves not only as analysis of NVDA and the semiconductor sector, but is a prediction for tomorrow - ""liberation day"".  

NVDA has a wide moat due to its CUDA software, and essentially holds a monopoly on parallel processing. Not only is this a focus of massive Mag 7 AI CAPEX, but it has an ever increasing amount of use cases due to developments in autonomous driving, IOT, robotics, healthcare, and more. While DeepSeek and tariff concerns have driven shares down recently, the company has an exceptional balance sheet and a 0.92 estimated EPS for its upcoming call.  

The current administration has clearly outlined its intention to be competitive in artificial intelligence, announcing in January Project Stargate, which aims to build out massive amounts of data centers in the United States with investment in AI deemed a strategic imperative.  

A close partner of NVDA, TSMC is the clear leader in semiconductor foundries due to its cutting edge nodes, which are protected by high barrier to entry and clear lack of viable domestic competition. Just yesterday, Commerce Secretary Lutnick stated to Bloomberg that TSMC's recent commitment to investing over $100 billion in the United States exemplified the actions this administration is seeking before distributing CHIPS Act grants. This investment was announced during TSMC CEO Wei's visit to the White House, with Mandango praising him as one of the most respected people in business, claiming a policy victory as Wei's actions reflected an intention to avoid tariffs through negotiation.  

Mandango is using tariffs as a form of economic brinkmanship, in an attempt to force companies to the negotiation table where they will capitulate and strike deals favorable to the United States. But with global supply chains being necessary for the semiconductor industry to function, the administration's stated goals of AI competitiveness, and the need for computation seeming insatiable, Mandango will carve out space in policy that is favorable for the sector. While the market as a whole may still see volatility in response to these policy changes, NVDA and the like will be an exception.  

TL;DR - Supporting domestic semiconductor design is critically important to the current administration's stated goals and sentiment around negative tariff impact is overblown.

I didn't get to post my DD with my YOLO because I failed a ban bet. Also I forgot to put it in the post.

Last week’s gold event: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab\_channel=Robinhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab_channel=Robinhood)

TLDR: IMO Robinhood is the best stock on the market right now with a great business model and the best team and has the most upside potential, even during a market downturn.

They had 1.5 million gold subscribers at $5/month last year. Now MORE THAN DOUBLED TO 3.2 MILLION.

Robinhood has the potential to become the next trillion-dollar company. Everyone is always looking for the next stock that will have NVDA or TSLA-like growth and I have good reason to believe that Robinhood is the one. Literally a 30-bagger since they’re at $37 billion, which is NOTHING. For example, about $1 trillion flew out of Nvidia in like a month and Robinhood only needs around $55 billion more to reach $100/share. They actually have a good business model leading the great leap forward in transforming finance with a CEO that is already mainstream. Man is on CNBC last week: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision)

They are going to smash earnings again IMO. Been taking money hand over fist. They already smashed earnings last quarter.

I’d say that inclusion into the S&P 500 is on the horizon. They just missed it last quarter but I see no reason why they can’t be in this quarter with a lot of stocks tanking. And we all know what happened when TSLA was put into the S&P 500 with a similarly well-known CEO known as the Elongated Muskrat. ROCKET EMOJI.

Robinhood is overhauling everything with their services, including the use of AI. That’s right. The AI buzzword. They cap their fees at $250/year for investment advisor systems.

Cash delivery? Bruh I’m never going to an ATM again: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

They have 12 partner banks so FDIC insurance is $2.5 million with them instead of $250,000: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/)

Robinhood is now VENMO/Apple Pay. You can send money to people instantly: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

Robinhood makes money on everything. Options, crypto, and now even straight-up gambling with prediction markets. Even in a terrible market they still make money on fees and subscriptions.

I don't really care about any litigation involving prediction markets and I don't think anyone else does either. Gambling always wins.

Cathie Wood bought like $25 million recently (Now holds 5% of ARKK’s holdings, TSLA is 11% for reference) and it was given a price target of $105 last week: [https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578)

IRA contribution and 401k transfer match is literally a money magnet.

People will live their entire financial lives through Robinhood. They have high-yield interest rates on uninvested cash and have a debit card. Kind of like how people use WeChat for everything.

They also have a credit card with 3% cash back on EVERYTHING (best on the market from what I’ve seen) = more money.

Great Wealth Transfer putting trillions of dollars in Millennials and Gen Z hands, going straight to RH for gambling, and especially on this sub.

Robinhood is honestly like a 7x leveraged SPY imo. Every time SPY is up 1% Robinhood is up 7%, and vice versa with the same chart pattern. SPY really only needs to go to 570 for HOOD to go to $50 from $42. $50 by the end of the week bc we will get the clarity from the big dude tomorrow.

Easy to use platform.

I am also predicting we have a face-ripping rally on liberation day because no one gives a fuck about tariffs. This is all about selling the rumor and buying the news so we all have certainty. JPOW also speaks Friday so my boy is going to pump it up.

2025-04-02 00:41:07,"‘Twas the Night Before Tariffs Since some of you enjoyed my prior post, ‘Twas the night before rate cuts. I wanted to share my latest and greatest version, ‘Twas the Night Before Tariffs.

-

’Twas the night before tariffs, and all through the Street,
The traders were anxious, all glued to their seats.
Their orders were placed with precision and care,
In hopes that the White House would choose to play fair.

The bulls clutched their charts, their bets running high,
While bears rubbed their hands, expecting a dive.
And I with my laptop, a coffee in tow,
Refreshed every headline, awaiting the blow.

When out on the tape there arose such a clatter,
I sprang to my screen to see what was the matter.
Away to my Bloomberg, I clicked with a flash,
Skimmed through the news, prepared for a crash.

The headlines declared in big, flashing red,
“Tariffs confirmed!”—my stomach felt dread.
Steel and aluminum, twenty-five strong,
With autos and tech not far along.

China, the EU, and Canada too,
All in the crosshairs—what else is new?
No deals, no breaks, no truce left in sight,
Just markets in turmoil and fear overnight.

Then what to my weary eyes should appear,
But Powell himself with a smirk ear to ear.
He lifted his mic and cleared out his throat,
Then gave us a speech with a familiar note.

“The economy’s strong, inflation runs high,
Rate cuts are coming, but don’t ask me why.
Tariffs may hit, but markets will fight,
Just buy the damn dip and you’ll be alright.”

And just like that, the futures turned green,
Traders rejoiced—it felt like a dream!
I sighed as I watched, for deep down I knew,
That Powell and tariffs were playing us too.

So I logged out my screen and turned off the light,
“Happy trading to all, and to all—hedge it right!”",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-04-01 14:20:26,"February US job openings slip to 7.6M, consistent with a healthy but decelerating job market WASHINGTON (AP) — Employers posted 7.6 million job openings in February, a sign that that the job market is slowing but remains healthy.

The number of vacancies fell slightly from a revised 7.8 million in January and from a 8.4 million a year earlier. Openings have come down more or less steadily since peaking at 12.2 million in March 2022 when the economy was still roaring back from COVID-19 lockdowns.

The American job market has proven surprisingly durable. But it has clearly lost momentum from the frantic hiring days of 2021-2023. And the outlook for hiring is cloudy as President Donald Trump pursues trade wars, purges the federal workforce and promises to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally.

On Friday, the Labor Department issues the jobs report for March. According to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet, it is expected to show that employers added 125,000 jobs last month, down from 151,000 in February and an average 168,000 a month in 2024. The unemployment rate is forecast to tick up to a still-low 4.2%.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-04-01 13:14:54,"Roblox announces new ad format, Google partnership to boost advertising business (Reuters) - Roblox on Tuesday launched a new format of video advertising on its gaming platform and announced a partnership with Google to help boost the growth of its nascent ad business.

Gamers can choose to watch video advertisement, up to 30 seconds long, in exchange for boosts, lifelines or resources in a particular game through rewarded videos.

In the coming weeks, brands and agencies will be able to purchase this new form of marketing either directly or through Google's ad platform, making Roblox's offerings more widely available to a larger set of advertisers.

With Roblox's main videogame platform seeing strong engagement and monetization, the company has been looking to expand its overall business with advertising to take advantage of its large Gen Z user base.

Roblox had 85.3 million Daily Active Users on its platform as of its quarter ended December 31, with the majority these users being above the age of 13.

""Because gamers are so entrenched in the experience itself, traditional ad formats haven't always been the right choice for app publishers, because they don't want to pull their audiences out of those games,"" Scott Sheffer, vice president of sellside monetization at Google said in a roundtable briefing.

Amid stiff competition in the gaming industry, the advertising business has allowed Roblox to diversify revenue streams and position itself as an attractive option for marketers in search of a large audience.

Reuters reported last year the company hired former Roku executive Louqman Parampath to aid its advertising business.

Roblox has also partnered with data measurement firms such as Cint, DoubleVerify and Nielsen to help brands track the performance of their campaigns.

Over the coming months, other ad formats such as billboards will come to Google Ad Manager, the company said.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

Started off March on the wrong foot hoping to scalp a quick profit on 2X leveraged AVGO in the morning…eventually was all in and 🥭 announced that tariffs were not negotiable so I closed out. Went heavy trying to short NVDA with 2X leverage the next day but my timing was off, had I waited an hour or so, would’ve easily made $10k vs going on a roller coaster for a week and barely making profit. Then made some decent money on TSLQ that day TSLA fell more than 10%. Was frustrated that I had chickened out and sold within minutes because it’s an unpredictable meme stock so the next day I went back in…and got my shit pushed in. Tried it again one more time and similar result. At this point realized I gotta stop using leverage and figured we were due for a bounce so I started steadily buying shares of NBIS last week. Absolute worst move I could’ve made lol. Cut my losses yesterday. 

What really hurts is if I had just held most of these positions for 2 or more weeks, I’d have done way less damage to my portfolio. On the plus side, I don’t owe the IRS any money this quarter! ",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-04-01 02:40:23,"Tariffs on Tech ***TLDR;*** *Analysts have emphasized the impacts of tariffs on commodities, autos, and tangible goods. However, the escalation of this tariff trade war will most significantly impact digital goods.*

***The Play TLDR***; *Short tech (QQQ puts, SPY puts, SOXL puts)*  


On April 2nd, we will (allegedly) learn what Donald Trump's plan will be for ""rolling back unfair trade practices that have been ripping off America"". Currently, analysts are primarily focused on illustrating the impacts of these tariffs on commodities and industrials. Understandably, since these asset classes are most commonly included in U.S. top export metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/azbupva7p4se1.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=38847b3d9ae4e0c455639abd44c036e1ec923be9

  
***THE POINT:***

  
In 1998, the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily banned tariffs on a class of assets called ""electronic transmissions"" (digital goods). This decision was made due to the rapid and unparalleled emergence of a new medium of information exchange called **the ""internet"".**

  
This ban prevented members from charging tariffs on goods provided electronically over the web. This temporary ban has been reviewed every two years by member countries, with the outcome being that it is mutually beneficial to keep the moratorium in place.  
This moratorium has played a ***critical*** role in U.S. tech's profitability:



[Current framework of free digital trade](https://preview.redd.it/sfyu2o6gp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4025959602f933ad83942912a6ffadfda84f97b)

In the example above, a company providing digital goods/services can trade freely with other countries. Digital transactions are not treated like physical goods transported internationally, where the goods must be declared at customs and taxes paid on their value.

  
This framework has been deemed to be in the best interest of the world for **decades**, and all political parties have managed to put aside their differences to ensure this framework's survival for the greater good. However, ***Trump's current economic offensive has put this framework at risk when/if other countries decide to ""strike back"":***  


[Framework for digital trade under tariffs](https://preview.redd.it/8ty1db2sp4se1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14880088e780e48b6796d64f5295d40e572fd0c)

***THE PROBLEM:***

Nearly [$270B or 70% of U.S. ""services"" exports](https://project-disco.org/21st-century-trade/new-government-data-shows-digital-services-exports-continue-to-drive-u-s-trade/) come from digital goods. Referring to the first picture of this post, this is roughly $62B more than the current top U.S. tangible goods export (Cars/Car parts (implied)). 

The problem, then, is derived from the following:

[\>50&#37; of the revenue of the S&P 500 IT sectors comes from foreign countries](https://preview.redd.it/7oxbsiqis4se1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c978c1b69a7f9b22ee05f14060974c87508e801)

NVDA, GOOG, META, AAPL, and other tech stocks would incur significant losses from the termination of the 1998 e-commerce moratorium.

***The Endgame:*** 

The tariffs proposed by the Trump administration will **invalidate** the 1998 WTO moratorium agreement **->** Foreign governments looking to push back against the U.S. tariffs will target U.S. tech and digital goods/services **->** U.S. tech margins will contract, as they are forced to account for taxes/tariffs on services provided internationally (i.e. Netflix pays tariffs on shows streamed by consumers in Europe) **->** U.S. economy will enter a recession due to the concentration of the top 10% of wealth (locked in the stock market) compromising \~50% of all U.S. spending

2025-04-01 00:22:00,"Fed’s Williams says rates to remain steady for 'some time' amid Trump tariff uncertainty New York Federal Reserve president John Williams told Yahoo Finance he expects the central bank to keep rates unchanged for ""some time"" as [policymakers watch](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-has-a-new-favorite-word-uncertainty-080031361.html) how new tariffs from President Trump affect the economy.

The tariffs, he added in an interview Monday, could produce ""more prolonged effects"" on inflation and he warned that it could take a few years to figure that all out.

""It is still early days to be able to come to a concrete conclusion around this,"" Williams said, noting that the central bank will be watching for ""indirect effects"" from new duties that “might not be fully felt for a couple of years.""

“Yes, we will see tariffs affect prices and then we will just have to keep watching how do those cascade into prices downstream to other goods in the economy,” he added, saying the Fed needs to “really have an open mind about how long these last in terms of their effects on inflation and the economy.”

The new comments from one of the Fed’s most influential policymakers come as central bankers wrestle with [the many uncertainties](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-has-a-new-favorite-word-uncertainty-080031361.html) ahead as the president rolls out his new trade policies. The next step comes Wednesday as the president is expected to unveil a set of new tariffs on many other countries.

The question for the Fed is whether any price increases caused by inflation will pass quickly or linger.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that his ""base case"" is that any extra inflation from Trump's slate of tariffs will be ""transitory.""

But [some of his colleagues worry the effects could be more persistent](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-has-a-new-favorite-word-uncertainty-080031361.html), adding to the uncertainties ahead for the central bank.

The Fed's goal is to get inflation down to its 2% target, but a key measure released last Friday remains well above that marker. The ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.8% year over year.

Inflation now stands at the level the Fed predicted it would be at year's end — and that's before some of Trump's most aggressive tariff plans kick in.

The worry among some economists and market watchers is that inflation could rise and economic growth could slow, creating a so-called stagflation environment that was last seen in the 1970s.

Williams said he sees no signs of stagflation ""now,"" citing an unemployment rate of 4.1% and headline inflation around 2.5%.

He also pledged, ""We will not let high inflation take root like it did in the 70s and 80s.""

At the same time, though, “there is definitely a risk of inflation being higher than what’s in the forecast.”

The economy, he said, is ""in a very good place,"" but he acknowledged a “lot of uncertainty” about how it will evolve this year.

He also noted that uncertainty has shifted somewhat more toward concerns about slowing economic growth, but he says also there is a greater risk of rising inflation.

“My own view is economy will continue to grow but slower than it did last year.”

Williams kept coming back to the level of uncertainty, using that word a total of nine times.

""There's a lot of uncertainty about how the economy will evolve and a lot of uncertainty about all the policy actions. We'll see about that, but also how the US economy, and importantly, the global economy, respond to these developments.""

Thus, for ""some time"" he expects the Fed to keep its rates unchanged as it did at its last meeting earlier this month.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

Seriously Just my opinion, and I hope I’m wrong when I say I really don’t see anything that’s bullish for this year. Between the job market data that may be poor in the near future, the increased cost of goods due to tariffs, and possibly less overall foreign investment also due to tariffs/the trade war, it’s looking pretty bleak. 

For those who disagree, what exactly are you banking on to pump the market?

When I say bleak, I don’t necessarily mean full blown recession. Although I’m not sure of what recession catalyst couldn’t be shunted by fractional reserve banking and bailouts, I see a rather poor performance at least for the rest of this year, as well as next year. 

I can think of one item, and only one item that would have actual weight in improving business productivity, possibly at the cost of jobs however. Some of you probably already had this buzzword typed up a: AI

Before those of you who say AI is bs, “just a chatbot” ect, it’s coming, regardless of what you think. AI stocks like NVDA (yes by proxy), META, etc, are not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about low level, fresh out of college paper pushing jobs, even up to project management to an extent. AI will effectively optimize industries that require data organization, data entry, drafting up timelines, reports, repetitive remedial tasks etc. Do not confuse this with “ITS GONNA TAKE ALL OF YOUR JOBS” it’s going to improve the effectiveness of those who utilize it first in their respective industries. The HR industry could benefit from it to an extent, but only with intense moderation at first. This eventually will transform the type of jobs available, one of which will be something of the sort of AI moderators. AI are not capable of being autonomous by any means at this point of time but can be used to expedite many processes. But it’s not happening yet, I haven’t heard any news of any large firm implementing a trained model thats able to increase productivity by some wild metric.

2025-03-29 21:38:16,"Bad Tax Planning Might Lead To An Even Higher Federal Deficit Seeing lots of stories of people who made a lot of capital gains in 2024 (whether it be stocks and/or crypto) and didn’t set aside any money for taxes.  They then got nearly wiped out by Tariff Man in the first 3 months of the year and are now staring at massive tax bills they simply cannot pay.

Not only is this bad from a micro perspective for each of these individuals, but if enough people have made similar mistakes, US tax receipts are going to be much less than anticipated.  This means our deficit will rise even more, likely sending bond yields higher and stocks even lower.  The fact the IRS has been gutted will only exacerbate all these problems.

2025-03-28 15:12:54,"Mineral production discussion Domestic mineral production plays?

(Yes Ik GGN is global, just read the post)

https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/

For those who don’t like to click links, or read long winded explanations: 

Mango signed an EO to effectively give out permits to kickstart domestic mineral production in the US.


Longer winded discussion:

Here’s the hook, any of the NVDA regards who absolutely love AI and chips and gaming ect, by proxy love minerals. 

Minerals are paramount to the technology sector in pretty much every corner of the field. From military industrial, to domestic infrastructure,  computer chips, vehicles, batteries, other electrical components, all dependent on minerals. 


For everyone else who’s interested, the short term play(s) will be now, and on Monday. The executive order signed last week on Thursday 3/20/25 states 10 days after the date of the order, a list will be composed of current domestic mineral “producers” with operations to be expedited in any permits required to continue operations/ increase or start new operations. 

Personally, my watchlist is comprised mostly of pennystocks due to the nature of the current industry. What I mean by this is generally speaking we as a country (USA) have outsourced much of the industrialization of the modern world to other countries with cheaper exports. Yes there are domestic producers that are larger, I’m somewhat weary of the performance of these in the longer term. 

To preface, I currently hold no positions as of yet, however last Friday 2/21/25 to last Monday 2/24/25 I scalped a pennystock (that I’m not allowed to name) based on the EO news.

The only domestic non pennystock on my list is BHP, an elderly company that has the infrastructure to produce already. I’m not holding currently due to lacker performance as well as looking to not make a play until the list comes out on Sunday. The other play I’ve made is GGN which isn’t domestic, but still a hedge as tariffs could generally increase the price of gold anyways as it already has for copper. And GGN pays a sweet dividend. 

If anyone is interested in the mining watchlist I’ll be playing, just look up domestic lithium, the pebble property (largest known copper deposit), or look up battery grade graphite. These are all separate operations fyi. 

I’ve done DD but all of my favorite picks are literally pennystocks for the short term. And yet again, asides from BHP, pennystocks dependent on the executive order handing out permits to start production. 

Anyone who has some insight + non pennystock tickers feel free to comment. Thanks

I’ve got two pets, and we don’t currently have pet insurance for them. I’ve done a bit of research on Trupanion (TRUP), and while I’m still on the fence about their policies (they seem to up your rate regularly but that feels like it happens across the pet insurance industry annually)… I was wondering about a different approach: what if I just bought a share of Trupanion stock every month instead of paying for a policy?

Right now, their stock is trading around $38, which is not close to what a typical monthly premium might cost. My thinking is that if my pets stay healthy, I’m building equity in a company that stands to benefit from more people using pet insurance (which I genuinely feel will happen over time) — kind of like a self-funded safety net that grows with the industry. Worst case, I can sell the shares if I ever do face a big vet bill.

Curious if anyone else has thought this way for like a different service or product or has any perspective on this idea — either as an investing strategy or should I just get a legit pet insurance. Is this dumb as hell? A waste of time? Somewhere in between?

**TLDR: This is an extremely high-risk play. I'm taking a degenerate, short-term bullish position on $QUBT and long-term short position on quantum computing stocks as a whole, with the anticipation of extremely volatile $QUBT price action soon.** 

Current Positions:

\- Short: mostly IONQ, with almost entirely put debit spreads

\- Degenerate short-term OTM calls: QUBT, rolling weekly



# Quantum Companies are Bad

I have returned after a couple years away to bring good tidings and some DD about a play I believe will have some extreme volatility in the coming two weeks. Over the past six or so months, quantum computing stocks have had a wild ride. Up 1200% down, [pimp slapped hard](https://qz.com/quantum-computing-stocks-nvidia-ceo-rigetti-dwave-ionq-1851771538), recovered some and currently teetering towards inevitable doom.

  
That's right. They are all doomed. Overvalued, overhyped and **running out of steam**. You don't need me to tell you that these companies are trash. Many big names have been trashing the industry, [Martin Shkreli](https://x.com/MartinShkreli/status/1895480382629556486) and [Kerrisdale Capital](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/investments/ionq/) being two of the most notable.

# Why Do I Care about QUBT

While all of the quantum companies have little to show for their insane valuations, QUBT is a real gem. Despite missing last quarter's disappointing earnings of -$0.47/share (est. -$0.05) they maintain a respectable market cap of \~$1.1B while having nothing to sell. 



***IF YOU READ ANYTHING ON THIS POST, READ THIS PARAGRAPH.*** Per the [S-8 filed 3/21/2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000101376225001115/ea0235205-s8_quantum.htm), insiders for $QUBT were recently approved to sell their shares. **Only two insiders stated immediate intent to sell stock by this coming Monday (3/31/2025).** As of 3/27/2025 only one insider has sold, with the Chairman of the Board[ Yuping Huang selling 200,000 out of his 27-million currently owned shares two days ago](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758009/000196858225000237/xsl144X01/primary_doc.xml). The other insider expressing intent is a director who only owns 207,000 shares. **Assuming the Chairman is done selling, insider dilution shouldn't be a near-term worry, but is always possible.** Currently, [multiple firms are suing the shit](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8f5ad3653710c57c&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1129US1129&sxsrf=AHTn8zpwApo4bS8d-5dXiXB8EM1N_8SZgg:1743160180622&q=qubt+lawsuit&tbm=nws&source=lnms&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpmDtIGL1r84kuKz6yAcD_igefx-eKq1gCPHF3zhthFoneNn6lL83lY3KLybUMxCNDhMUtbCQQO9t_eGxoOP_s3rR9imLItfH1uBSfE1eodVtu3j9NNltXXuqTU0fP37mjBusR7Pi0GSAtMbdArRUTLOsC4dN4POVlfGKFb_2PiWfOtFnP-rmmP8j0Odsy8bbuGSebXg&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwi74uja0ayMAxUCCnkGHfJkOOIQ0pQJegQIIRAB&biw=1718&bih=1304&dpr=1) out of this company. Any insider selling this close to the unlock would just accelerate the dumpster fire.

>Barclays said on Thursday it favors fixed income investments over equities for the first time in ""several quarters"" and warned global economic growth was at risk due to U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating tariff policies.Despite hurdles such as rising prices and poor fiscal outlooks in Western economies, the risk to fixed income assets was less than to equities, Barclays analysts said in a note.



>We have been overweight global equities over fixed income for several quarters, even as valuations became stretched. But now, the policy risks strike us as tilted largely to the downside

My take on the news is pretty simple: Banks took way to long to get honest with their customers about how bad it would come. And american institutions probably won´t even yet, just out of fear of reprisals. Other - less kindly mannered people - may claim it is, because they want to suck up every possible dime out there, before the music stops. Basically the fact that any banks are lighting the beacons of Gondor should be shocking enough to let everybody pause.

2025-03-28 03:19:27,"I believe that Coreweave is already underwater, and their IPO is an exit strategy for existing shareholders: Coreweave is set to launch its IPO tomorrow at $40 per share. Its NVDIA backing sounds promising, but balance sheet constraints and shady collateral backing for massive loans can’t be brushed off.

Coreweave managed to skyrocket into the headlines over the past couple of years after solidifying its position as a significant AI player. This parabolic rise was, in part, thanks to a $2.3b loan collateralized by NVDIA GPUs. However, a simple google search of the collateral posted for this loan, Nvidia H100 tensor core gpu, will likely lead you to the same conclusion illustrated below.

When Coreweave secured an initial $2.3b in cash from investors, they posted NVDA chips as collateral. The rapid cash injection buoyed them onto the AI scene relatively quickly. However, that form of collateral has proven itself to be less than fundamentally sound over the past couple of years.
*Source: (https://www.reuters.com/technology/coreweave-raises-23-billion-debt-collateralized-by-nvidia-chips-2023-08-03/)*

When Coreweave posted the NVDA chips as collateral in 2023, the value was marked-to-market at ~$47,000/processor. That same processor is now worth 30% less. For context - their total loan value came in at a whopping $7.6 billion near the end of 2024. Simply put: technology is advancing quickly, and the collateral is rapidly degrading in value. Additionally, the cost to rent these GPUs is falling - why own the asset when you can rent it for 1/100th the price?

In December of 2024, Coreweave breached terms of their $7.6b loan through various ""unspecified"" actions and ""accidents"". However, their primary lender Blackstone was generous enough to waive these shortcomings and amend their loan.
*Source: (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798dex1015.htm)*

Wildly enough, the cause of the near technical default was found to be due to an overstatement of collateral - Coreweave was alleged to not have tangibly held as many GPUs as they reported. The ""administrative accident"" was Coreweave attempting to sure-up it's reserves as to avoid defaulting on it's obligations.

That same company, ""backed"" by NVDA, will now IPO tomorrow. At $40 per share, the implied value is $19b. As it stands today, that $7.6b loan (that they nearly defaulted on 3 months ago) is nearly 1/2 of their entire market cap.

Just keep that in mind before smashing that buy button tomorrow after the buffer period.

The tariff rate/flat import tax for Canada and Mexico is 25%. ANYTHING coming from these two will have a import duty charge of +25%.

i couldnt find 2024 figures but gold imports in 2023:

128.40 Tonnes from Canada ($6.84B) and 36.8 tonnes from Mexico ($1.18B)

That's 165.2 tonnes imported from these two countries and the total US consumption for 2024 was 200 tonnes.

Per CNBC, More than 600 tons, or almost 20 million ounces of gold, has been transported into vaults in New York City since December last year. If retail, commercial and investment demand keeps up and the vaults start to run dry for delivery i think we see a huge spike in gold as demand outruns supply. Same situation with silver.

	•	Dongfeng-Peugeot-Citroën (China, under joint venture)

Stellantis has a strong presence in Europe due to its legacy brands (Fiat, Peugeot, Citroën, Opel) and also maintains production in emerging markets like Brazil and China.”

If they are already making Fiat and Jeep in Brazil(hint this is to avoid tariffs in Brazil) what’s to say they do not do the same in the US.

-assets $207b

Alright degenerates, I did some real homework. Went back to 1928 and looked at every time the S&P 500 hit a fresh all-time high, then dropped 10% or more — a classic “correction.” Here's the TL;DR:

If SPX hits an ATH and then corrects -10%, but then bounces back up above that correction level, it always drops back down to 91% of the ATH (aka a -9% drawdown from the top) within 60 trading days.  
Doesn't matter how good the rebound looks. Doesn’t matter how hard Greenspan/Bernanke/Yellen/JPow flexes. It’s like gravity.

2- in case of uncertain and bearish market investor tend to like energy stock and you can see a rise in volume

3- they focus on domestic production wich can be boosted by the tax war, focus on april 2

Over the last two days, I rolled 30 of 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps (cash secured puts) to NVDA 5/16 120 csps and received an additional $11k premium. Wrote another 30 NVDA 5/16 110 csps for $9k premium. Altogether 40 NVDA 5/16 110 csps and 30 NVDA 5/16 120 csps for a total of $35k premium. I picked the expiration to be one week before earnings so the premiums are not inflated by earnings and I would like to have the option to make another earnings play if the price is around $120.

After factoring in premiums, the average cost to purchase is $105 and $115 respectively. I picked $110 and $120 because NVDA’s lower range is around $110 and upper range is around $140, so in the worst case (of my) scenario, I would be purchasing NVDA at the lower end of the range. If I’m wrong, then NVDA is a good stock to hold long term.

I don’t need to bore anyone to list all of the reasons NVDA is a buy including exploding need and revenue from data centers; just beginning to scratch surface on AI in automobiles/partnership with AI companies; growing domestic revenue (47% 63B revenue) that won’t be impacted by AI restrictions…

Worst case scenario, NVDA tanks below $110 and I am forced to buy 7,000 more shares. In that case I will just hold on to a stock that I am confident will double in 5 years.

2025-03-26 06:48:31,"$AVXL - Alzheimer’s Drug that Actually Works - Pending EMA Approval 
1. Introduction to Blarcamesine

Blarcamesine, also known as ANAVEX®2-73, is an investigational oral therapy developed by Anavex Life Sciences. It functions as an agonist of the sigma-1 (SIGMAR1) receptor and muscarinic receptors, aiming to restore cellular homeostasis disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.

**Additional reading:** https://www.sotcanalytics.com/

2. Clinical Trial Insights

A pivotal Phase 2b/3 randomized clinical trial evaluated blarcamesine’s efficacy in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients over 48 weeks. The results were promising:
	•	Cognitive Benefits: Blarcamesine significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks, indicating a notable preservation of cognitive function.  ￼
	•	Safety Profile: The therapy demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no significant neuroimaging adverse events reported.  ￼
	•	SIGMAR1 Wild-Type Subgroup Analysis: In a prespecified analysis focusing on patients with the common SIGMAR1 wild-type gene (excluding carriers of the mutated SIGMAR1 rs1800866 variant), blarcamesine exhibited an even greater clinical benefit. These patients experienced a 49.8% reduction in clinical progression at 48 weeks on the primary cognitive endpoint ADAS-Cog13. **This represents over 70% of the patient population.** 

These results were published in a peer reviewed journal article over 50 doctors/researchers  representing 42 external organizations: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2274580724006083

3. Market Potential


The Alzheimer’s therapeutics market is poised for substantial growth:
	•	Current and Projected Market Size: Valued at approximately $4.05 billion in 2022, the market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.99%, reaching around $15.19 billion by 2030.
	•	Valuation of Alzheimer’s Drugs: An FDA-approved Alzheimer’s drug can carry a market value of approximately $43.4 billion. For instance, Biogen’s Aducanumab was valued at this figure upon approval. Similarly, drugs in Phase 3 trials, like Eli Lilly’s Donanemab, have been valued around $20.2 billion, with potential increases upon receiving Breakthrough Therapy Designation.

**AVXL inexplicably has a market cap under $1B with over 25% of the float short**. If they even sniff the valuations argued here, we’re looking at a triple digit share price. 

https://ipwatchdog.com/2021/10/26/assessing-much-alzheimers-drug-worth/id=139154/

4. Investment Considerations

Investors should monitor:
	•	Regulatory Milestones: Blarcamesine has received EMA filing acceptance for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, marking a significant step toward potential market approval. **A decision should be made by the end of 2025** 

	•    Upcoming conference on April 5th which Anavex is expected to reveal additional subgroup analysis of their trial. 

5. Conclusion

Blarcamesine represents a compelling candidate in the Alzheimer’s therapeutics sector. Its innovative mechanism of action, coupled with favorable clinical trial results, positions it as a potential frontrunner in addressing a significant unmet medical need. Given the substantial market valuations observed with similar drugs, blarcamesine’s successful development and approval could yield considerable financial returns.

**Due Diligence: TTD $70 Calls (07/18) – 100 Contracts at $4.80**  
**Ticker:** The Trade Desk (**TTD**)  
**Position:** **100x $70 Calls** (July 18, 2024)  
**Entry Price:** **$4.80** ($48,000 total risk)  
**Current Stock Price:** **~$65.50** | **Option Price:** **$4.85** ($48,500 position value)  
**Thesis:** Betting on a swift $70+ breakout.  

 **1. Why I’m Playing This**  
- **Earnings Momentum:** TTD surged **20%+ post-Q1** (May 2024) on ad-tech strength.  
- **Technical Setup:** Broke $65 resistance; next stop **$70-75** (pre-ATH zone).  
- **Catalyst Potential:** Summer streaming demand (Olympics, Netflix ads, etc.).  


 **2. Position Math**  
- **Breakeven:** **$74.80** ($70 strike + $4.80 premium).  
- **Profit Potential:**  
  - At **$70**: Calls worth ~$3.00 (-37.5%, but salvageable).  
  - At **$75**: Calls worth ~$5.20 (+8% + intrinsic value).  
  - At **$80**: Calls worth ~$10.20 (+112%).  
- **Max Risk:** **$48,000** (if TTD ≤ $70 by July 19).  


**3. Why 100 Contracts?**  
- **High Conviction:** Expecting volatility squeeze toward $70+.  
- **Liquidity Managed:** Using limit orders to avoid slippage (bid-ask: $4.75/$4.85).  
- **Exit Plan:** Scale out at $6.00 (25% gain), $8.00 (67% gain), etc.  


 **4. Risks I’m Watching**  
⚠️ **Theta Decay:** Losing ~$1.00/week in July (accelerates fast).  
⚠️ **Low Volume:** Open Interest = [X] – may need to exit early.  
⚠️ **Macro Risks:** Weak ad spend data or market pullback.  


**5. Trade Management**  
✅ **Added Stop Loss:** Auto-sell 50% if TTD < $63.  
🎯 **Profit Targets:**  
- **25% at $6.00** (sell 25 contracts).  
- **50% at $7.50** (sell 50 contracts).  
- **Let runners ride** if $75+ breakout.  
🔄 **Hedge:** Considering $75 puts if market turns.  


 **6. Why Post This Now?**  
- **Accountability:** Putting my money where my mouth is.  
- **Discussion:** Are others playing TTD? Better ideas?  
- **Transparency:** No pump—just sharing my thesis.  

---  

**Final Thoughts**  
**Bull Case:** TTD’s CTV growth justifies $75+.  
**Bear Case:** $4.80 premium is steep—needs a strong move.  
**My Bet:** Worth the risk for a **10-20%+ move in 4 weeks**.  

**What’s Your Take?**  
- *""Would you hold or hedge this position?""*  
- *""Is $70 realistic by July?""*  
- *""Any red flags I missed?""*

2025-03-25 03:02:52,"Thoughts on Quantum Computing - from a Physicist *New post, now with screenshot.*

My background: PhD student in Physics, working on quantum information on the theory side. I do know many friends that work on the experimental side, though.

As much as I appreciate the interest in my field over the last year or so, I personally think it's best to keep expectations realistic. Especially with some DD posts I have seen posting incomplete information, and even blatantly false statements (in Physics). I want to clear those up and some personal thoughts on some quantum computing startups.

**Quantum communication doesn't allow for faster-than-light propagation of information**

I have seen a DD post that says IonQ achieved faster than light communication via networked entanglement of particles. VERY common misconception about entanglement. Affecting one particle in a pair of entangled particles does not affect the other, it will just break the entanglement. It is proven to be impossible via the [no-communication theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem).

**Breaking Cryptography, more like breaking your portfolio as you baghold for 10-20 years**

Yes, Shor's algorithm is real. No, it won't be possible to break encryption until we get a quantum computer with at least 2000 qubits. The most optimal implementations  of Shor's algorithm requires around 2n qubits to factor an n-bit number.

As an example for RSA-1024, you'll need more than 2000 LOGICAL qubits. Factoring in error correction, which requires multiple PHYSICAL qubits to represent one single logical qubit, you'll most likely need upwards of 100k physical qubits before we can actually break real-world encryption. I personally see that taking at least 20 years, but some more optimistic estimates place it at 10 years.

**IonQ**

There's many DD touting IonQ's lower error rates, longer lifetimes, and all-to-all connectivity. While all of these are true, they often forget to mention one drawback: the gate speeds.

It takes around a thousand times longer to execute an operation on trapped ion platforms compared to superconducting platforms (which Google, IBM uses). While finance/techbros that have never touched a quantum mechanics textbook will point to the fact that the lifetime of the qubit is at most on the order of 100 seconds, and think that quantum algorithms won't require more than that time anyways, so this shouldn't be an issue.

However, keep in mind that the algorithms that are most likely to see real-world use are optimization algorithms like VQE and QAOA. These algorithms need to repeat the quantum circuit many, many times as they gradually change the parameters in the circuit to find the optimal set of solutions.

Furthermore, if your circuit output is some continuous variable that's encoded into the probability of measuring one of the states, then you need to repeat the circuit upwards of thousands of time to get a good estimate of that probability.

As a conservative estimate for a simple optimization algorithm, let's say that you need 1000 repetitions of the circuit, each one taking 1000 repetitions to get the output, and each run of the circuit takes 1 second on a trapped ion computer. That takes 11 and a half days on a trapped ion computer, as compared to 17 minutes on a superconducting one. If we use a pay-by-the-minute model in the future for quantum computers, then IonQ likely has to charge less per minute, since you need more time to run an algorithm on their platform. Sure, they can charge a premium for the lower error rates, but if they charge the same amount per minute as superconducting platforms, then customers are likely to simplify the algorithm they want to run (to be more tolerant of errors) to get a solution at a thousandth of the price.

**Rigetti**

Honestly, looking at their spec sheets for their platforms, and comparing it to Google's and IBM's, I don't see them pulling ahead at any point. Their board also literally kicked out the original founder for (allegedly) being a prick in general.

**QUBT**

Literally never seen any substantial work from them.

**Disclaimer**

This is not financial advice. I've literally got my portfolio tied up in RKLB and LUNR because I don't know anything about space outside of Kerbal Space Program. I don't invest in quantum because I know quantum. I invest in space because I don't know space.

this is all the money i have after working full time in highschool at wendy's (literally) and all four years of college as a lab tech saving and investing as much as possible. I believe I’ll make a of minimum 2x off this investment.

valaris (val) is the largest offshore drilling contractor by fleet size, operating 53 rigs, including 18 floaters (13 drillships and 5 semisubmersibles) and 35 jackups. the company provides contract drilling services to major oil companies such as exxonmobil, chevron, bp, shell, petrobras, and equinor. following a downturn in the offshore drilling industry and a 2020 bankruptcy restructuring, valaris emerged with no long-term debt, a modernized fleet, and an improving financial position, allowing it to capitalize on the offshore drilling recovery.

offshore drilling fundamentals are improving as the supply of rigs has tightened significantly. a decade ago, the global offshore fleet consisted of approximately 300 vessels, but that number has now dropped to around 150, with only 120-130 of them actively operational. meanwhile, demand for offshore drilling has rebounded, leading to a sharp increase in day rates, which are the prices oil companies pay to lease a drilling rig per day. since 2022, drillship day rates have doubled from around $250k per day to $500k per day. during the last cycle, they peaked at $800k per day, and current market conditions suggest they could reach $900k per day. offshore drilling has also become more cost-competitive, with breakeven prices of around $40 per barrel, compared to $60 per barrel for most u.s. shale projects.

valaris has one of the strongest financial positions in the industry. unlike competitors such as transocean, which is burdened with over $6.5 billion in debt, valaris currently operates with minimal net debt relative to industry peers, giving it a major advantage in capital allocation and flexibility. despite its strong position, the company remains deeply undervalued. with an enterprise value of approximately $5.1 billion compared to an estimated $30 billion replacement cost for its fleet, valaris is currently trading at just 16 cents on the dollar relative to its assets. management has been actively repurchasing shares, reducing the share count by around 5% since 2021, and the company maintains a buyback yield of approximately 5%, further enhancing shareholder value.

valuation metrics further support the investment case. based on projected fcf, valaris is trading at a p/fcf of about 10x for 2025 and 4x for 2026. ev/ebitda ratio stands at around 5x for 2025 and is expected to drop to 3x in 2026, whereas industry peers typically trade at 8-10x. net asset value analysis suggests a target enterprise value of around $27 billion, implying a potential 7x upside from current levels.

if drillship day rates continue their upward trajectory and approach $900k per day, applying a peak-cycle nav multiple of 1.5x would imply an enterprise value of approximately $27 billion, which translates to a share price of around $500, representing a 10x return from current levels. in a more conservative scenario where day rates stabilize between $600k and $700k per day, a 1.25x nav multiple would still yield an enterprise value of $18 billion to $22 billion, implying a share price in the range of $250 to $350, or a 5-7x return. even in a bearish case where day rates hold at $500k per day, applying a 1.0x nav multiple would still result in an enterprise value of $14 billion to $18 billion, meaning the stock could reach $150 to $200 per share, offering a 2-3x return from current levels.

there are risks to consider, such as oil price volatility, which could affect offshore drilling demand. however, offshore projects now have lower breakevens than shale, making them more resilient to price fluctuations. execution risk is another factor, as management must continue optimizing capital allocation and fleet utilization. additionally, the market may take time to recognize the disconnect between valaris’s asset value and its current share price.

despite these risks, valaris presents one of the most compelling deep-value opportunities in the market. it is trading well below its asset value while benefiting from rising day rates, improving financials, and aggressive share buybacks. in a conservative scenario, the stock has 2-3x upside, while in a more bullish offshore drilling cycle, it could rise 5-10x from current levels. with strong industry tailwinds and a clean balance sheet, valaris offers an asymmetric risk-reward opportunity that is rare in today’s market.

i believe offshore drilling is the best investment opportunity over the next couple years and im all in.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

# Addressing the Impact of the Semaglutide Shortage Ending

On February 21, 2025, the FDA declared the semaglutide shortage over. This was big news for Hims & Hers, as it came just days before their earnings call. While the timing was unexpected, it ultimately worked in HIMS’ favor, allowing management to adjust guidance and directly answer difficult questions on the call.

**What Was the Semaglutide Shortage, and Why Does It Matter?**

Pharmaceutical companies are incentivized through patents, which grants them exclusive rights to sell patented drugs and recoup the costs of research and development. For example, Novo Nordisk holds the patent for Ozempic (semaglutide) until 2031. However, if the drug is in high demand and the company is unable to meet supply, the FDA can declare a shortage. This allows generic compounded versions of the drug to be sold by other companies, even while under patent protection. This allows companies like HIMS to sell their own generic GLP-1 to help meet the demand of the drug during a supply shortage.

With Novo Nordisk now claiming they can meet demand; the FDA has removed semaglutide from the shortage list. As a result, companies like HIMS can no longer sell compounded generics commercially.

However, there’s a legal loophole:

* Semaglutide is commercially available in fixed doses (0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 1.7mg, and 2.4mg).
* If a specific prescribed dose is unavailable, it can still be compounded and sold.

Since HIMS specializes in personalization, many of its GLP-1 prescriptions are in personalized, custom dosages. HIMS has committed to continuing to provide these dosages where clinically necessary.

CEO Andrew Dudum has made it clear that while HIMS can no longer sell commercial dosages of GLP-1, that they will continue providing personalized prescriptions where clinically necessary.

On the earnings call, CFO Yemi Okupe emphasized this point: ***“What we see in general in our platform is, as Andrew mentioned, many of the folks that are coming to our platform have come and have had struggles with GLP-1s in the past. That was the genesis behind one of the reasons behind why we very quickly looked to roll out the personalized dosages as well.****""*

He also noted that “a majority of individuals on the platform today are utilizing personalized dosages versus the commercially available dosages.”

**Example of HIMS GLP-1 Onboarding Regimen:** Note the customized dosages.

# The Financial Impact of GLP-1

My prior estimate for GLP-1 Revenue as of Q3 2024 was 10-15% of total revenue. The company has now confirmed $225 million in GLP-1 revenue for 2024, approximately 15% of total FY24 revenue.

*Subscriber growth and revenue growth existed prior to GLP-1 announcements and offerings at HIMS.* HIMS has been a disruptive and rapidly growing company before introducing GLP-1 into the equation.

Of note: GLP-1 was primarily a revenue and subscriber driver in the short term with compressed margins due to initial investment costs. The company has made it clear that economies of scale take time for new product lines.

**Gross Margin Compression from 82% to 79.45% YoY.** Expected per HIMS due to GLP-1.

https://preview.redd.it/uev7s8sv1oqe1.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4bc59ed9a5dfccd2c7cea498c132351bb751368

I believe that GLP-1 ‘hype’ certainly fueled much of the recent stock craze surrounding HIMS but it was not, and has not been, a core tenet of my thesis for the investment. HIMS is well-positioned to adapt, already planning to:

* Continue offering personalized GLP-1 dosages.
* Bring back commercial GLP-1 with any new shortage.
* Expand its weight loss portfolio, emphasizing its oral weight loss medications (already generating $100M+ in revenue within seven months of launch).
* Introduce liraglutide as an alternative weight loss treatment in 2025.

While there will be customers that leave HIMS, many customers who initially joined for GLP-1 are expected to transition to other offerings.

# Debunking the “No Moat” Argument

I disagree with the idea that HIMS lacks a competitive moat…

# Brand & Marketing Moat

While I have been aware of HIMS since IPO, it first caught my attention as an investment opportunity due to its standout marketing strategy. HIMS has executed on a marketing strategy that has created a strong, trusted brand. Simply put, HIMS makes Erectile Dysfunction medicine “cool” rather than clinical or embarrassing.

HIMS has positioned itself with a first mover advantage in the personalized healthcare and wellness industry. Its focus on:

* Personalized treatments
* Combination medications
* Direct-to-consumer accessibility

…makes it a unique player in the telehealth space.

# Convenience & Consumer Experience

The U.S. healthcare system is a nightmare for many - complicated, expensive, and frustrating. Long wait times, insurance headaches, and unclear pricing leave patients feeling powerless. HIMS provides an alternative with a consumer-first approach that eliminates these barriers.

* Accessibility – No waiting rooms. No insurance approvals. Just frictionless, direct-to-consumer care.
* Discretion – Patients can access treatments privately and comfortably.
* Transparent Pricing – Consumers know exactly what they’re paying before they commit.

Unlike traditional healthcare, where patients feel like passive participants, HIMS allows consumers to take control of their health.

The out-of-pocket cost of care continues to rise, with more Americans opting for high-deductible plans. As co-pays and other expenses grow faster than inflation, affordability is an increasing concern. HIMS is well-positioned within this cash-pay segment, offering upfront pricing and a premium experience.

From discreet online consultations to direct-to-door delivery, HIMS is designed for convenience. Consumers can browse treatments, receive personalized recommendations, and have medications shipped - all from their phone or computer. This retail-like approach makes healthcare as simple as shopping online, removing the stigma and complexity that often deter people from seeking treatment.

Unlike traditional telehealth models that feel transactional and impersonal, HIMS created a premium consumer engagement. Rather than passively following doctor’s orders, users customize their care, select treatments, and interact with a brand that prioritizes them.

In a world where convenience, transparency, and trust drive consumer decisions, HIMS offers a modern and approachable healthcare experience, a key differentiator.

I believe HIMS has and is continuing to grow their brand moat as a trusted, transparent, premium, personalized health and wellness provider that brings a consumer experience to the healthcare system.

# Regarding Share Dilution: A Manageable Concern

HIMS has been diluting shares at about 8% per year, which isn’t ideal. It is important to understand that HIMS is a young, high-growth company that is utilizing Share Based Compensation to attract, retain, and incentivize talent. Free cash flow growth is rapidly outpacing share-based compensation. I believe the impact of Shared Based Compensation to be reasonable and manageable and will minimize over time.

# 2025 Outlook:

# Growth Opportunities & Catalysts

* **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** 100M+ Americans suffer from weight-related health problems.
* **New Categories:** HIMS plans to launch 1-2 major new categories annually. Of focus with new acquisitions: low testosterone, menopause support, and peptides.
* **At-Home Lab Testing:** New service offering that will support fricitionless access to hormonal treatment via HIMS while expanding personalized, data-driven care. Paired with MedMatch, HIMS' AI-driven treatment-matching service, at-home lab testing enhances the ability to identify additional products for consumer benefit. Utilizing data to personalize the consumer experience, increasing offerings and awareness of appropriate products based on data driven needs may lead to increased cross selling.
* **Subscription Growth:** CEO Andrew Dudum aims for 10M subscribers, a realistic target based on historical trends. On the earnings call, Dudum noted: ***""I think 10 million subs on the platform to me feels really quite in reach. And I think, frankly, pretty straightforward from a growth standpoint if you look at historical growth over the last five to six years. My optimistic hope and personally ambition would be to try to achieve this in the next five to six years.""***

In addition, average revenue per subscriber is becoming a larger driver of revenue growth: ***""While the addition of subscribers remains the primary component of our growth, monthly online average revenue per subscriber is becoming a more meaningful contributor as well. Monthly online average revenue per subscriber increased 38% year-over-year to $73 in the fourth quarter.""***

This is a positive long-term trend, though the recent spike was undoubtedly impacted by the sales of higher-priced GLP-1 products.

# Risks & Challenges

* **Regulatory Risk:** As always, there are regulatory risks for healthcare companies (and opportunities - i.e. favorable changes to compounding regulations).
* **GLP-1 Competition:** Commercial semaglutide providers are working hard to limit access to compounded GLP-1. In addition, a direct-to-consumer cash option for Wegovy has been released but remains more than 2x the cost of HIMS offering. (Again, I see GLP-1 as a bonus here, not a core tenet of the HIMS thesis.)
* **Execution Risk:** The recent FDA ruling on GLP-1 has put HIMS under increased scrutiny. Fortunately, the decision came before earnings, allowing the company to adjust its guidance and answer questions. Despite this, HIMS maintained a strong outlook, reflecting confidence in its execution of weight-loss products. While I’ve never viewed HIMS as purely a GLP-1 investment, it will be important to see how their estimations of personalized GLP-1 offerings and transition to aliterate weight loss products delivers.

# Valuation:

Keep in mind that all of my calculations are estimates, intended to provide general guidelines for my personal decision-making.

# Multiple Valuation: Price/Sales

During the Q4 2024 earnings call, HIMS CEO Andrew Dudum reiterated confidence in the company’s long-term growth trajectory, stating that the goal of reaching 10 million subscribers was well within reach: **""I think 10 million subs on the platform to me feels really quite in reach. And I think, frankly, pretty straightforward from a growth standpoint if you look at historical growth over the last five to six years. My optimistic hope and personally ambition would be to try to achieve this in the next five to six years.""**

With this target in mind, let’s assess a potential share price through the lens of the Price-to-Sales ratio, using Dudum’s stated goal alongside Monthly Average Revenue Per Subscriber (ARPU).

In Q4 2024, HIMS reported a Monthly ARPU of $73. However, this figure was temporarily elevated by GLP-1 prescriptions. A more balanced estimate comes from the full-year 2024 average, which stood at $63 per subscriber per month. We’ll use this more conservative metric for our valuation.

# Determination:

I believe HIMS is a great, fast-growing, yet volatile company that remains undervalued. I first invested after its initial quarter of profitability, starting at $12 and averaging up to $15.89 before Q4 earnings. Prior to Q4 earning, I felt a FV of HIMS was around $57 and was comfortable purchasing below $45. Following the post-earnings dip, I added in the mid-$30s, bringing my cost basis to $27.10.

Despite concerns over GLP-1, I see the reaction as overblown. My long-term conviction remains intact, and I continue to believe in 10x+ potential over the next decade.

Currently, HIMS is at my target portfolio weighting, but I’d consider adding more if the stock remains in the low-$30s to high-$20s. Based on a 20% margin of safety using a 25% free cash flow growth rate discounted at 10%, I view $46.64 and below as an attractive price. Purchasing in the low-$30s aligns with the more cautious 6 million subscriber scenario.

HIMS isn’t just a GLP-1 stock—it’s a disruptive healthcare brand. The business continues to scale, expand, and differentiate itself, making it a compelling long-term investment opportunity.

2025-03-24 15:49:19,"HUYA - 41% Yield - WSB DD! Time for some good old fashioned DD! 

HUYA is the ultimate buy of 2025, let me tell you why. 

First off, China stocks are soaring, nearly every major institution is going long China. HUYA is best of class, owned by Tencent, the management team is all Tencent, one of the best operators in China and here’s the kicker .. HUYA has NO DEBT and $900 Million in cash, current market cap 750M .. YES, you read that correct they are trading for less than their CASH balance. It makes NO sense, and I believe it will be corrected quickly. 

HUYA just announced MAJOR news - they are retuning 50% of their market cap back to investors in COLD HARD CASH. HUYA is paying a $1.47 cent dividend in July. That is a 41% dividend yield ! The stock is currently $3.25 per share. Buying now will give you a cost avg around $1.80 for a Tencent Backed growing company. Very few times in life will you find a 40% yield on your cash, this is one of them. 

More news, they are buying back $100M worth of stock. They bought $1M worth of their own shares in ONE DAY and The CEO made an announcement, “we feel the stock price does not accurately reflect the business or future of the company.” For those that follow China stocks, BABA made an almost identical statement around $72 per share, now look at BABA (up 100% from that announcement) 

Next; PATTERNS …. Last year HUYA announced a large dividend of $1.07 - over the following month the stock climbed the entire amount of the dividend plus much more. People, institutions, etc will pour into this company to lock in that massive 40% divided. I expect the stock to climb at least the amount of dividend plus some before July. 

For every 10,000 shares of HUYA you own, you are making $14,700 in cash payment just this year. In my opinion this stock should return to $6.50 before dividend - meaning 100% gains, plus 40% dividend yield. 

HUYA is the best stock in the market at this moment. 

Position: LONG 41,000 shares, with plans to buy much more on any dip. ",https://i.redd.it/00cn96efsnqe1.jpeg,reddit/wallstreetbets
2025-03-24 15:27:56,"Again new post the Insiders #HaveSpoken 1. **Markets Are Rallying - But Don’t Let That Fool You** Hey! Happy Monday. Yes, stocks are flying higher today. The Dow jumped almost 400 points before the open. And yes, the mood on Wall Street is suddenly… cheerful. **But don’t get too comfortable.** Because under the surface, nothing has actually changed. The reason for this bounce? Trump. Tariffs. And a little dose of wishful thinking.
2. **Let’s break down what’s really happening** Over the weekend, *Bloomberg* and *The Wall Street Journal* dropped some reports that lit a fire under the market. Here’s what they said:So now, the narrative is: “Maybe the tariffs won’t be that bad after all.” And just like that, **risk is back on**. **Wall Street’s playing a dangerous game here** Make no mistake - **the tariffs are still coming**. That part hasn’t changed. The only thing that’s shifted is the tone. It’s softer. A bit more “flexible.” But structurally Trump’s whole economic plan is still about dismantling globalization, forcing production back into the U.S., and making imported goods more expensive. That *will* hit supply chains. Especially the ones that depend on semi-finished goods moving back and forth across borders. And that’s what’s making investors uneasy - even as the market rallies.1
   * Trump’s planned *reciprocal tariffs* \- which are set to be announced April 2 - may not be as brutal as people feared.
   * There could be **exceptions for certain countries**.
   * They may not directly target specific industries like autos, semiconductors, and pharma after all.
   * And Trump hasn’t reacted to the leaks yet - which is giving investors a strange kind of hope.
3. **Here’s what’s adding fuel to the fire this week**Put all that together, and you’ve got a technical rally. **But it’s not about confidence in the economy.** It’s just positioning, timing, and a bit of blind optimism. **What about earnings?** It’s a quiet week.Economic data... same story.
4. So overall, **no major landmines this week**, and that’s helping keep the risk-on mood alive.11
   1. **Seasonal flows**: Historically, from late March through mid-April, capital flows tend to support U.S. equities. It’s been that way since 1928. Nothing magical - just calendar-based inflows.
   2. **Pension buying**: Goldman Sachs estimates pension funds will buy around **$29 billion in U.S. stocks** this week as they rebalance at the end of Q1.
   3. **CTAs (trend-following funds)** are switching: These quant-driven funds were heavily short. Now their models are flipping neutral or bullish - adding more buying pressure across the board.
   * Tonight: KB Home reports after the close.
   * Later this week: Dollar Tree, Paychex, Jefferies, Lululemon - a few names, but no heavy hitters.
   * Nothing that’s likely to shake the market.
   * Today we got flash PMIs. Manufacturing ticked up a bit (52.7), services slightly weaker (51.2). Nothing shocking.
   * Friday brings the PCE inflation data - the Fed’s favorite gauge - but expectations are muted.
5. **Meanwhile, China is making moves too** According to *The Wall Street Journal*, China is considering **export restrictions** aimed at the U.S. That’s a signal: they’re trying to ease tensions, maybe offer a trade olive branch ahead of the April 2 announcements. There’s also talk of a Trump-Xi conversation in April - possibly a symbolic birthday summit (they were born a day apart). That could help dial things down. Or not. **Let’s zoom out for a second** This rally is happening in the middle of a much bigger shift:You couldn’t make this stuff up. Hardliners are pushing for aggressive trade action - and they’ve said openly, **a recession is “worth it”** if it means reshaping the U.S. economy.
   * **Foreign investors are pulling money out of U.S. stocks.**
   * The **Dow-to-Gold ratio** is starting to break down - a pattern that tends to show up before major crises.
   * Corporate earnings **are falling**, even as prices climb. 
   * You couldn’t make this stuff up. Hardliners are pushing for aggressive trade action - and they’ve said openly, **a recession is “worth it”** if it means reshaping the U.S. economy.

1. It’s not strength. It’s a relief bounce.All it takes is one Trump tweet, one policy change, one unexpected reaction from China - and this whole thing could reverse fast. Keep your guard up. **Hope is not a hedge.**
   * The tariff threat *isn’t gone*, just temporarily softened.
   * Seasonality and positioning are doing the heavy lifting.
   * But the deeper risks - falling earnings, policy instability, deglobalization - haven’t gone anywhere.

All it takes is one Trump tweet, one policy change, one unexpected reaction from China - and this whole thing could reverse fast. Keep your guard up. **Hope is not a hedge.**",,reddit/wallstreetbets

The positive news came just two weeks after the company's lunar lander mission [ended](https://www.investopedia.com/intuitive-machines-stock-sinks-for-second-day-after-moon-mission-mishap-11692855) following a landing mishap, which had sent shares tumbling. 

Intuitive Machines reported fourth-quarter revenue that jumped nearly 80% year-over-year to $54.7 million. However, costs skyrocketed, with adjusted [EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp) sinking 146% to negative $11.2 million.  

Backlog increased 22%, hitting a quarterly record of $328.3 million. The firm credited the gain to $303.7 million in new awards primarily associated with contracts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and task order modifications to other contracts. 

# CEO Firm Expanding Reach Beyond NASA

2025-03-24 13:22:21,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February (Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE), [VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

2025-03-24 01:21:41,"Turkey's economic collapse imminent **TLDR: Aug 15'25 $TUR $30 Put Market to Open tomorrow morning if trading allowed and here's why:**

* Political unrest amid jailing political opponents
* Just today opposing party leaders announced widespread boycotts - 50m+ people total cohort size
* Turkey's current financial system is flawed, they rely on high interest government bond sales to finance USD-TRY imbalance 

1. **Analysis of Current Reserves:**

* As of March 2025, Turkey’s total (gross) foreign exchange reserves are approximately **$85 billion**.
* However, most of these reserves consist of swap agreements and external debts; the actual (net) reserves are likely close to zero or even negative.
* The truly available (liquid) reserves for rapid intervention are, at best, around **$20–40 billion**.

2. **Activities That Could Rapidly Erode Reserves and Their Effects (Data Supported):**

The following scenarios could rapidly deplete the reserves in the short term:

**Mass Bond Sales and Foreign Exchange Purchases**

* If 30 million people convert an average of **$500** per person from TRY to USD, it would result in a reserve loss of **$15 billion** in a short time.
* *(30 million people × $500 = $15 billion)*

• **Mass Withdrawal of Deposits from Banks (Bank Panic)**

* The total deposits in the Turkish banking system amount to approximately **$450 billion**.
* Even if only **5%** of these deposits are withdrawn in a panic (about **$22.5 billion**), it could deplete more than half of the reserves in one go.

**Tax Payment Refusals and Consumer Boycotts**

* Turkey’s annual tax revenue is approximately **$150 billion** (2024 budget).
* Even a short-term **20%** tax boycott (a loss of about **$2.5 billion per month**) would create a serious budget deficit within a few months.

**Boycotts of Critical Sectors such as Energy and Transportation**

* Turkey’s monthly energy imports average about **$5 billion**.
* Even an extra crisis cost of **20%** in this area could result in an additional monthly reserve loss of **$1 billion**.

**Widespread Labor Strikes**

* A general strike lasting just one week in Turkey would cost approximately **$4–5 billion**.
* Strikes lasting several weeks could rapidly deplete the reserves.

👉 **Total estimated short-term reserve loss (within one month):**

It could be around **$20–40 billion**, which is nearly equivalent to all of Turkey’s actual liquid reserves.

3. **Timeline Scenarios for Collapse (Supported by Figures):**

🔴 **Aggressive Scenario (Full Bank Attack and Demand for Foreign Exchange):**

* If **10%** of bank deposits are withdrawn, it would create a cash need of about **$45 billion**.
* The current liquid reserves (assumed to be around **$30 billion**) would not be able to meet this demand.
* The economy and banking sector could collapse within **7–14 days**.

🟠 **Moderate Scenario (Partial Capital Outflow and Consumer Boycotts):**

* Demand for foreign exchange, tax losses, and reduced consumption would push the monthly reserve loss to around **$5–10 billion**.
* The existing reserves could be depleted in about **2–3 months**, bringing the economic crisis to a critical point.

🟡 **Controlled Scenario (Strict Capital Controls and External Financial Support):**

* Capital outflows could be limited to **$1–2 billion per month**.
* With IMF or external support (for example, **$10–15 billion**), the endurance of reserves could be extended to **6–12 months**.

I think this will lead to a government shutdown or change of power in the end. I don't see a humane way current government regaining back control without going bankrupt. If they do, it will be through terrorizing their own people and hijacking their bank accounts and other assets. If you make money out of this, I will suggest you sell when you see decent profits and buy yourself something nice. Be quick to exit this one.

EDIT: Turkey just BANNED short selling on the Istanbul Stock Exchange for one month.

When short selling is banned, you know that BIG TROUBLES are always right around the corner.

Stay tuned.

2025-03-23 20:04:30,"SPY to 420 This is a weird post to write because half the people reading it are going to respond with *no fucking shit* but I'm seeing everyone from random WSB shitposters to fancy-pants investment bankers saying we've found the bottom so let's fucking do this.

The Atlanta Fed's [GDPNow](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) currently has a -1.8% annualized decline in real GDP for Q1 2025. What does that mean? Well, the [BEA](https://www.bea.gov/help/glossary/recession) will tell you that ""the often-cited identification of a recession with two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth is not an official designation"" and ""the designation of a recession is the province of a committee of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)""—but that two quarters of negative GDP growth definition is pretty useful in practice. One quarter of economic contraction can be quickly forgotten, but two is generally a sign something is seriously wrong.

A -1.8% annualized decline in one quarter is only like a -0.45% actual decline, but be honest with yourself: does it look like we're fucking done? GDPNow's methodology is similar to the BEA's except that instead of waiting for all the data to come in they update it continuously as new data is released. That does mean the decline could shrink as more data comes in—but it also means the inputs are all stuff that's already actually happened, stuff like ""construction spending"" and ""retail sales"". It doesn't even try to model the effects of leading indicators like [collapsing consumer sentiment](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/14/university-of-michigan-consumer-sentiment-survey-drops-in-march-to-57point9-worse-than-expected.html), much less predict the future effects of policy changes.

So let's talk about those policy changes, starting with tariffs, since those have been getting a lot of attention. We seem to be at the stage where people who want to believe everything's going to be OK are combing through Trump's statements for whatever scraps of reassurance they can find, which they can do because of Trump's tendency to speak in word-salad and promise everything to everyone.

For example, here's an [answer](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/21/trump-says-therell-be-flexibility-on-reciprocal-tariffs.html) he gave  on Friday to a question in an Oval Office press conference (transcription mine):

>People are coming to me and talking about tariffs and a lot of people are asking me if they can have exceptions, and once you do that for one you have to do that for all, so I mean generally, I did something interestingly during two weeks ago, I gave the American car companies a break because it would've been unfair if I didn't and everybody said ""oh he changed his mind on tariffs!"" I didn't change my mind I helped our, you know, sort of big three, big four, I helped some of the American companies and instead of taking it properly they said ""oh he changed his—"" I don't change, but the world ""flexibility""'s an important word, sometimes there's flexibility, so there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal so that if China's charging us 50% or 30% or 20%, and I don't mean China I mean anybody, any country, Canada, nobody knows that Canada's charging our dairy farmers, they have 270% tariffs, nobody knows that, nobody knows that, they have up to 400%, they have a couple of tariffs, at 400%, nobody knows that, nobody talks about that.

He then went off on an extended tangent about why Canada should be a US state before ending by reiterating that ""nobody knows that they were getting 270% tariffs on dairy products"". And people have, in apparent seriousness, cited this answer as a reason for optimism, because he said there will be flexibility! Beyond the obvious rebuttals, it should be noted that the example he gave of ""flexibility"" was a [one-month pause](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-lutnick-2b269614084027a4894aa14f3dc16227), meaning tariffs are still coming for U.S. automakers.

The economic effects of mass-firings, along with cancelling leases and other contracts, don't get discussed as much. But they'll likely be quite serious. Mass-firings of federal workers could have an apocalyptic effect on the economies of Virginia and Maryland, effects by no means limits to the public sector, because those public sector employees are going to have to cut their spending at countless private businesses. Similarly, cancellation of leases threatens to crash real estate markets.

And while the many of the effects may be concentrated in the DC metro area, there are major government offices spread throughout the country, so the mass-firings and lease cancellations will create little pockets of economic pain everywhere. Some effects may even be concentrated in rural areas—like the effects of [cancelling contracts to buy food from American farmers to distribute as food aid](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311663/farmers-will-be-hit-hard-by-the-dismantling-of-usaid).

Then there's the fact that many of the fired federal workers were actually doing stuff that's really important for the US economy to functions. Firing FAA workers threatens to hurt airlines and domestic tourism. Firing people at the CDC makes it harder to fight bird flu, which is bad not just for the egg industry but also beef and dairy. And so on.

Finally there's Trump's immigration policies, whose effects range from farm workers being afraid to show up for work to completely fucking international tourism because apparently multi-week detentions of random tourists from [Europe](https://apnews.com/article/border-tourists-german-canadian-detention-immigration-408cd27338e8065268fabc835f8b0c34) and [Canada](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney) is a thing we're doing now. Recently there was a forecast of a [5% decline in international tourism](https://fortune.com/2025/03/17/foreign-tourism-us-forecast-trump-tariffs-trade-war-russia-ukraine-war/) which under the circumstances actually strikes me as optimistic.

I suspect the main reason a lot of people resist seeing what's staring them in the face is that during Trump's first administration the economy did okay until COVID hit. ""Util COVID hit"" is a pretty big caveat, especially with RFK Jr. running HHS, but never mind that. The bigger issue is that during his first term, there were still people in both the Republican congressional caucuses and his own administration willing to tell Trump ""no"". We don't seem to have that anymore, unless you count X Æ A-12 telling him to ""shush"".

So TLDR; all signs point to us already having experienced an economic contraction in Q1 2025, and there's every reason to expect it to continue into Q2 and beyond. A recession, in other words. Of course, the question we all want to know on WallStreetBets is what this means for the stock market.

Faithful believers in the efficient market hypothesis will insist everything I've described and more is already ""priced in"", to which I say: LOL. So far the S&P 500 has fallen 10% peak to trough, but a 10% drop is a fucking sneeze by stock market standards. I remember back in 2015 when my boss told me he was selling all his stocks because of some bullshit with China. I *didn't* sell because I didn't want to be the guy who sold at the bottom, but by the time the 2015-2016 selloff was over the S&P 500 was down 14%—over fucking *nothing*.

An actual recession probably means a much more severe decline in stock prices. If I believed Trump administration messaging about [""temporary pain""](https://gazette.com/news/wex/trump-officials-acknowledge-temporary-pain-amid-tariffs-and-market-unease/article_0186aba5-768e-572d-be2f-e9f2ef31ecbf.html), the precedent I'd be looking at is Paul Volker more or less causing a recession on purpose to fight inflation, which involved a 27% decline in the S&P 500. But Trump and Musk aren't Paul fucking Volker, so I'm expecting a greater than 30% decline.

How much more than 30%? Beats me, but assuming a decline of 31.5% decline from SPY's $612.93 peak yields a nice, easy-to-remember target price of $420. It could easily go even lower, but will almost certainly bounce back, and a lot of people aren't going to want to miss the recovery. Therefore, I wouldn't feel too stupid going long SPY at $420. At its current price, though, count me out.

So what do you do about it? Full-porting SPY 12/31 430p is obviously insanely risky. And unfortunately, given the range of tail-risks we're facing—the debt ceiling, Trump deciding to actually act on [previous comments that much US government debt might be fraudulent](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud), or even fucking with the banking system—I don't think any position is entirely safe. That said, here's what I've currently got.  ""Other"" stocks is GLD, domestic bonds are overwhelmingly TIPS:",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-03-23 15:35:07,"Is the sell off of overvalued stocks to retail the savior of our economy? So I have been thinking. What if the selling of all overvalued stocks and basically shit to retail the smartes move for Big Institutions? 2008 happened because institutions tried to sell each other the hot potato quickly devaluating everything until one got stuck with a huge pile of shit and had to go bankrupt and the rest had to be saved by the government and its taxpayers.

What if they learned from it (smth very unlike but there is a small chance they did) and decided the best way to go is to animate the retailers to buy a big chunk of that shit so that on their books they only hold a small part of it and the loses are mainly eaten up by retail?

I know this sounds weird because either way retail gets fucked but in this option no institution has to go bankrupt or have to receive hate from general population since they can simply say: hey guys you decided to invest in smth that is highly speculative you lost it on your own, but look at us since we are pros at this we didn’t loose as much. 
Unlike if they would loose it it would be more of a: hey guys we tried reaching for the sun and got burned in the process.

Instead of discounting each period's cash flow and adding them up, I decided to discount the net income in each period (using SoFi's cost of equity estimate) instead and then multiply that by the mean P/E ratio estimate for the finance industry, essentially deriving the stock price in today's value for each period of earnings. Finally, I averaged the results to find the price target for SoFi.

**Is this a methodologically correct method of financial modeling? No**, but I believe that this is a way to keep in mind the time value of money when evaluating P/E ratio ahead of today's earnings period.

**My conclusion is that SoFi is underpriced and has a decent upside ahead.** Please be mindful that the model's assumptions are not grounded on a scientific basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions could result in a drastically different conclusion.

Lastly, I understand that the extension of forecasted periods would ultimately result in the target price in future periods converging to zero as the discount factor increases exponentially, so the result I have is also highly dependent on how many forecast periods to include. For good measure, I decided to extend for 5 more years after the member growth is expected to stabilize at 3%.

2025-03-21 16:58:08,"UAE commits to $1.4 trillion US investment, White House says WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates has committed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework in the United States after top UAE officials met President Donald Trump this week, the White House said on Friday.

The framework will ""substantially increase the UAE's existing investments in the U.S. economy"" in AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, and manufacturing, the White House said in a statement.

The White House did not outline how UAE investments would reach $1.4 trillion, with some of the deals unveiled as part of the framework having already been announced.

The only fully new deal appeared to be an investment by Emirates Global Aluminium in what would be the first new aluminum smelter in the United States in 35 years, the White House said, adding the plant ""would nearly double U.S. domestic aluminum production"".

""Developing a primary aluminium smelter in the U.S. has been part of EGA's ambitions for several years,"" a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement.

The UAE, an oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S., is looking to deepen investment ties with Washington and is emerging as a global leader in AI, one of the sectors it is betting on to diversify its economy away from energy.

In September, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met former U.S. President Joe Biden, in the first visit of a UAE president to the White House, as the two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in areas such as AI, investments and space exploration.

Gulf sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi's $330-billion Mubadala, are already big U.S. investors, and Trump and his family have business ties to the region.

OVAL OFFICE MEETING

Trump in January asked Saudi Arabia to spend upwards of $1 trillion in the U.S. economy, over four years, including purchases of military equipment, and said this month he likely would make his first trip abroad to the Gulf country to seal an investment agreement.

The deal, which could happen between this month or the next, would come at a time when Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's biggest economy, has been taking a more prominent role in U.S. foreign policy. The Gulf country is set to host diplomatic talks around Ukraine involving the United States and Russia next week.

The White House said on Friday the UAE agreement resulted from a meeting that Trump held on Tuesday with national security adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the Oval Office and a dinner that Vice President JD Vance and several cabinet members held with the UAE delegation, which included the heads of major UAE sovereign wealth funds and corporations.

Among the tie-ups highlighted on Friday was a partnership between UAE sovereign wealth fund ADQ, which is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon, and U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners, for a $25 billion U.S.-focused initiative to invest in energy infrastructure and data centers. That had been previously announced two days ago.

A commitment by XRG, the international investment arm of UAE state oil company ADNOC launched in November, to support U.S. natural gas production and exports with an investment in the NextDecade liquefied natural gas export facility in Texas, had previously been made public last year by ADNOC, under Biden.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-03-21 16:08:55,"RIVN a quick technical analysis backed by underlying drivers This is my first dd post and it’s mostly a look at  the technical chart with some flavorings of qualitative analysis driving this on the back end. No chatgpt and I am highly regarded. 

**First point: reverse head and shoulders**

A. initial low post ipo slide @$11.68

B. one higher low in late 2023 @$15.12

C. ATL early 2024 @$8.26

D. Higher low late 2024 @$9.50

In these 4 points(circled in graph), is developing, somewhat of a reverse head and shoulders pattern, I believe there might be opportunity for breakout, especially after the recent market wide selloff driving higher risk stocks like RIVN down sharply. Confirmation would be around $15-16 and I believe this could bring it to the $20-35 range

**Second point: Descending triangle Sellers meeting buyers floor**

As seen in the chart, there is a clear series of lower highs(blue downward sloping line), and support from buyers around $11. The price has been flirting with the upward trend line, and I believe there are two scenarios. 

1. The stocks goes sharply lower, driven by broader market forces, marking it’s capitulation and goes sharply higher from abysmal lows. 

2. Market trades sideways or upwards and RIVN starts an upward trend more gradually

Either way, I see an opportunity in trading this stock. With it losing $5.3B last year, I can’t convince myself to invest in it as a long term value play (my normal investments), but I can see it as an acquisition target from a bigger auto player or PE (private equity) fund who wants to get skin in the EV game, either of these two giving an insane valuation justification for short term trading. 

I wouldn’t be so confident in this if it weren’t for the, I guess I’ll call it, among other things.. “EV biased administration” and it’s partnership with players like Amazon and VW. 

I’m a buyer in the $7.75 - $9.50 range. Might buy some today just to get some skin in the game as I don’t hate it at $11.35, just don’t love it. 

Also, I think it’s important to note, I’m cautionary with options on this play, especially deep OTM Calls that will be worthless if an acquisition price is less than strike after a 30-40% pop from rumors of M&A (merger and acquisition).

2025-03-21 15:55:21,"FedEx shares slide as annual forecast cuts stoke worries on economy (Reuters) -FedEx's shares fell 11% on Friday after the parcel delivery firm cut its annual forecasts, fanning worries about the health of U.S. manufacturing amid uncertainty from the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on trading partners.

CEO Raj Subramaniam warned a day earlier that the company was navigating a very ""challenging operating environment"" and ""weakness in the industrial economy"" was weighing on its higher-margin business-to-business volumes.

The company's shares hit their lowest in nearly two years on Friday. FedEx and rival UPS are viewed as barometers for the global economy due to their involvement across a swathe of industries.

Shipments from companies that produce goods used in manufacturing drive substantial cargo volumes and high-margin deliveries for the delivery firms.

UPS' shares were down 3%, while European peer DHL fell 2.2%.

U.S. President Donald Trump's on-and-off import tariffs have created uncertainty for businesses, prompting them to be more cautious with their spending in an uncertain economic landscape.

Analysts have said Trump's levies could trigger a recession and a trade war, further hammering demand for transportation and delivery services.

""FedEx's Q3 print and full-year forecast cut will likely exacerbate concerns of structural pressures in the parcel business,"" Morgan Stanley said, adding that it may even overwhelm the company's cost-cutting program.

FedEx has been reducing costs as demand for lower-margin e-commerce deliveries from companies such as Temu and Shein outpaces higher-margin business-to-business shipments.

""Management noted weakness in the industrial economy and, while macro is a factor, we believe structural forces are a far bigger headwind than the market thinks,"" Morgan Stanley added.

The company lowered its fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $18.00 and $18.60, from $19 to $20 previously.

The forecast cut itself was far from a surprise, but the magnitude, particularly for one remaining quarter, was greater than feared, Evercore ISI said.

2025-03-21 10:26:17,"Germany Set for Trillion-Euro Defense and Infrastructure Splurge Germany’s mammoth spending package cleared its last parliamentary hurdle, paving the way for as much as €1 trillion in civilian and defense investments to jolt the region’s economy and reduce its military reliance on the U.S.

But economists and defense experts have warned that for Germany and Europe to reap the full benefits, the wall of money would need to be flanked with ambitious—and not necessarily popular—structural overhauls, including tax, bureaucracy and labor-market reforms.

Germany’s spending plan, equivalent to around $1.08 trillion, has drawn cheers across a continent unnerved by signs that the U.S. is downgrading its security commitment to Europe and seeking a rapprochement with President Vladimir Putin’s Russia, which is seen as the region’s biggest threat.

“Berlin is breaking the piggy bank, and it’s doing it even before the next government is in office,” said François Heisbourg, a Paris-based expert on strategy and defense who has advised the French president. “Germany is giving itself the means to become a military force to match its economic and strategic weight. That’s a sea change.”

Friedrich Merz, winner of last month’s German election and the man in line to become chancellor, has pledged to focus on European cooperation after the departing government became increasingly distracted by internal frictions between the coalition’s three parties.

The German spending plan he developed marks a U-turn for Berlin, which for years preached fiscal discipline to its European neighbors while letting its military atrophy for lack of investment. The package’s scale dwarfs a €158 billion defense fund floated by the European Commission this month to support military spending in the European Union and fund future help for Ukraine. 

The German decision is especially credible, Heisbourg said, because it would directly benefit German arms manufacturers, including Rheinmetall, an armored-vehicle and ammunition manufacturer, and others that have proven their ability to deliver large orders quickly on behalf of Ukraine. 

The spending package is made possible by a constitutional amendment that effectively exempts defense-related spending from the provisions of Germany’s strict fiscal rules, which ban budget deficits bigger than 0.35% of gross domestic product. This exemption will apply not just to spending on military hardware but also on cybersecurity, intelligence and civil protection. 

Because Germany has relatively low public debt, the upshot is that it will from now on be able to spend as much on defense as investors are willing to lend it—at least and as long as overall spending doesn’t breach the EU’s more lenient spending rules. 

“The priority now is to make sure that the money is being spent efficiently and not only to plug gaps in hardware,” said Ben Schreer, executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Europe office in Berlin. “Now we have the possibility to think about the capacities that we need to build—in software, in artificial intelligence, in communications, in space—if we’re going to become less dependent on the U.S.”

The amendment also creates a €500 billion investment fund to be spent on the country’s long-neglected transport, communication, digital and power infrastructure as well as on measures to combat climate change, over the next 12 years.

The legislation was designed so that only new investment is eligible for funding—a provision meant to prevent existing investments from migrating from the ordinary budget into the fund.  

After the amendment gathered the necessary two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament on Tuesday and Friday, the package’s implementation will depend on detailed legislation that will be drafted when the next government takes office.

This is likely to happen at the end of April as Merz’s conservatives and their prospective center-left coalition partners are still locked in negotiations over the government’s policy agenda for the next four years. While the two buried their differences to push the spending package through, they remain at odds on issues ranging from how much should be done to combat illegal immigration to the merits of cutting income and corporate tax.

The spending package has caused some consternation in conservative ranks after Merz campaigned against relaxing the country’s fiscal rules. But most economists agree that the combination of rapid rearmament and much-needed infrastructure investments could be a boon for an economy that has barely grown since before the Covid-19 pandemic and has been in recession for the past two years.

The plan could help Germany’s GDP grow by 0.3% this year and 2.1% by 2027 if it is implemented quickly, according to insurer Allianz. While Germany’s public debt was set to fall rapidly on the previous spending trajectory, it could now reach 68% of GDP by 2027, Allianz said—still low by European and U.S. standards and likely without a sizable impact on the country’s funding costs. 

But the group’s economists also warned that unlocking and maintaining this level of growth over time without rekindling inflation would require Germany to implement a number of structural overhauls, including fixing its unsustainable pension system, increasing incentives to work and innovate, and cutting taxes, not all of which would be popular with voters.

Likewise, the economic fallout from the extra military spending would be biggest if Germany ensures most of the money is spent at home and in Europe and a substantial share of it goes to research and development, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. This would increase the likelihood that military innovations find their way into the private sector, thus boosting growth further. 

“The planned defense spending can give Germany a structural boost if it is spent correctly,” said Moritz Schularick, the institute’s president.

Analysts said the next government would also need to fix slow, bureaucratic and inefficient procurement processes at the Defense Ministry to ensure that the extra money borrowed on capital markets can actually be absorbed by the military.

With the first quarter of 2025 showing notable financial turbulence, one of the key drivers seems to be U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to re-impose tariffs. This move has caused a sharp drop in the S&P 500 as investors rapidly divest from U.S. equities, sparking a shift towards European and Chinese markets.

On top of that, emerging economies like Turkey, Indonesia, and Colombia are also feeling the pressure due to their own domestic political issues. With so much volatility, do you think this will lead to long-term instability in the global markets, or could this be a short-term reaction?

2025-03-20 22:32:24,"FedEx cuts full-year results forecast on ‘uncertainty’ in economy, bad weather (Reuters) -FedEx Corp lowered its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Thursday, as the parcel delivery firm battles stubbornly soft demand and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on trading partners.

""Our revised earnings outlook reflects continued weakness and uncertainty in the U.S. industrial economy, which is constraining demand for our business-to-business services,"" Chief Financial Officer John Dietrich said in a statement.

FedEx shares were down 5.5% to $232.69 in after-hours trade, while rival United Parcel Service stock fell less than 1%. Those companies are seen as barometers for the global economy since their business touches so many types of businesses.

Both companies have been slashing costs as less lucrative e-commerce delivery demand outperforms that of higher-margin shipments between businesses.

The industrial sector includes firms that produce products used to make other goods. It drives significant cargo volume and more profitable deliveries for FedEx and UPS. Many executives in the U.S. transportation industry had been banking on the industrial economy returning to growth this year.

Those hopes appear to have been dented by new and threatened tariffs from the Trump administration. Experts are also concerned those import levies could spark a trade war that further weakens transportation and delivery demand.

Memphis-based FedEx on Thursday lowered its full-year forecast for adjusted profit to $18 to $18.60 per share. FedEx in December cut that profit forecast for the fiscal year ending May 2025 to $19 to $20 per share, down from its initial target range of $20 to $22 per share.

FedEx also expects revenue for the 12 months ending in May to be flat to slightly down year-on-year, versus its earlier forecast for it to be approximately flat.

For the third quarter that ended on February 28, FedEx reported adjusted profit per share of $4.51. that was up from $3.86 per share last year, but below average analyst estimates of $4.54, according to data compiled by LSEG.

FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam said the results came as the company was ""navigating a very challenging operating environment, including a compressed peak season and severe weather events.""

FedEx and UPS are locked in a fierce battle for market share, which analysts worry could lead to a price war.

FedEx and the United States Postal Service, its largest customer, ended their air cargo contract in September. UPS picked up that business, but in January said it was accelerating a plan to slash deliveries for its largest customer, Amazon.com.

FedEx in December announced long-awaited plans to spin off its profitable Freight division, a move analysts said could unlock up to $20 billion in shareholder value while clearing the way for FedEx management to focus on merging operations of its separate Express and Ground units to boost profits.

FedEx executives said on Thursday that the company remained on track for permanent cost reductions of $2.2 billion for fiscal 2025.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-03-20 19:11:02,"It’s time to call bullshit I’ll share a screenshot of my positions in a thread below, so if that’s all you’re here for go ahead and look.

My fellow regards, I believe it’s time to call bullshit on this market. Please understand, I don’t care who you voted for… I guarantee I like you a hell of a lot more than I like the banks, and that is exactly who the winner is going to be unless people wake up to the reality of our situation quickly. 

Before touching any kind of political news, let’s start with market indicators. 

BofA’s recent mm survey showed that most MM’s are reducing their share of US equities (source 1 below), there are other signs the banks are getting out as well (check my second to last post), BlackRock is struggling to find buyers. 

At the same time, a record number of American households now own stock in US equities (source 2 below). Now, from what I know about American households (I live in one), most of us live paycheck to paycheck… we don’t really have money to put into stocks willy-nilly.


So what does all of this mean? 

Well, my thesis is that the average American has their rent/mortgage in US equities tied up in stocks like Tesla right now as an act of patriotism… what saddens me most is that I appreciate this general sentiment (not for Tesla necessarily, but I do actually love my country despite what the news may tell you), but the banks are taking advantage of it. So what happens when all the sudden everyone has to pay their bills? 

That’s right… another mass sell off. 

Please believe me when I say that I hope I’m wrong, this is not going to be good for average, working people with, at the very least, good-hearted intentions… but I don’t see any signs to indicate that I am.

Now we’ll touch a bit on economic outlook and history:

We are currently still in a battle with inflation, JPow said it yesterday, even before tariffs we were looking at 2 more years before we return to normal and the outlook with tariffs puts it all on pause. He hedged to say ‘they aren’t sure how tariffs will affect inflation’, let me fill in the gap there: either tariffs will affect inflation (because the costs are passed on to consumers) or they will affect earnings (because companies absorb them)… the money has to come from somewhere. If it affects inflation, the fed will be forced to raise interest rates or at the very least pause on cuts indefinitely. If it doesn’t affect inflation, it will affect earnings/growth… if this sounds familiar, then you may have heard of stagflation. And if you study the history of the federal reserve, you may know what the solution to that problem is… Volcker’s hammer. You can look it up yourself but the gist is that in the late 70’s we had been battling inflation and stagnant growth for years, until Paul Volcker was appointed to head the federal reserve and raised interest rates to 20%… it absolutely crushed the economy, sent us to the stone ages… but it did reset our inflation and led us into a very booming 80’s. 

I want to reiterate… I don’t like either side politically, they’re all in bed with the banks. The only reason I’m posting this is because I’m angry at the thought of them getting super leveraged on overpriced stocks and then dumping it on average people. This has so many shades of 2008 it’s not funny. Feel free to argue, bet against me, whatever… I genuinely don’t care. I’ve been a value investor since I was 14 and I’m currently 28. I held through 2020 and 2022, this time feels much much different. 

Whatever you decide to do with this information, be safe out there.

2025-03-20 18:52:00,"Nvidia CEO Says He Was Surprised That Publicly Held Quantum Firms Exist (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he didn’t realize there were publicly traded quantum-computing companies when he made earlier comments that caused industry stocks to crash.

“My first reaction was, I didn’t know they were public. How can a quantum company be public?” Huang said at an event Thursday focused on the still-nascent technology.

The executive had said in January that “very useful” quantum computers are probably decades away, causing shares of IonQ Inc. and other companies to tumble. Thursday’s event — part of Nvidia’s weeklong GTC conference — invited some of those very companies on stage to discuss their prospects with Huang.

The quantum-computing industry aims to use the unique properties of subatomic particles to process data much faster than traditional semiconductor-based electronics. The technical difficulties of building practical systems have meant that the field is still in an experimental stage. In addition to quantum upstarts, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are also trying find practical uses for quantum systems.

The companies on stage at Thursday’s event included IonQ and D-Wave Quantum Inc. Huang said it was natural for this new form of computing to take many years to develop since it was so novel. The companies might be able to convince him that quantum computing is happening more quickly than he expected, he said. “But I don’t know,” he joked.

“This whole session is going to be like a therapy session for me,” he said.

The six company leaders on stage gave him a variety of answers. Some argued that quantum computers are already in use to solve difficult science problems. Others posited that the technology is even closer to helping advance traditional computing.

Executives also said it wasn’t unreasonable to spend a decade honing a technology that will have such a large impact. Loic Henriet, who runs the French company Pasqal, argued that the term “quantum computing” was misleading. Quantum processors will help act as accelerators — working alongside traditional computers — rather than replacing them, he said.

2025-03-20 18:50:24,"Lyft to Offer Driverless Ride-Hails ‘as Soon as This Summer’ (Bloomberg) -- Lyft Inc. said it plans to offer driverless vehicles on its platform “as soon as this summer,” and that it sees human drivers transitioning to other work such as fleet management as autonomous rides become more ubiquitous.

The company has been spending more time pitching its vision for the future of its gig-economy business model as it plays catch-up in offering autonomous rides. Driverless ride-hailing has become more commonplace in some key US markets through competing platforms. Like rival Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft envisions a hybrid future where human drivers will complement autonomous vehicle fleets, especially during periods of peak demand.

The autonomous-vehicle economy will create new jobs such as remote vehicle support, fleet management, and map data labeling and validation, said Jeremy Bird, Lyft’s executive vice president in charge of driver experience, said Thursday in a blog post. He also confirmed the driverless service could begin as early as this summer. The company had previously committed to a launch sometime in 2025.

Bird also said the idea of drivers eventually owning autonomous vehicles is core to the company’s strategy, and this will become more feasible as the cost falls for those cars. That would enable drivers to operate small fleets, not unlike how some Airbnb Inc. hosts have made a business out of renting out multiple properties. Elon Musk has a similar vision in which Tesla owners would monetize their vehicles when they aren’t personally using them.

“Even when technology encroaches on human jobs, it doesn’t eliminate the need for humans altogether — especially when workers can provide value that the machines cannot,” Bird wrote. “Humans are features, not bugs, and we’ll continue to find a way to reward those that provide great service as part of a thriving hybrid network.”

Lyft and Uber currently rely on millions of drivers to quickly match with riders. But Lyft, which only operates in the US and Canada, is more exposed to increasing competition from domestic autonomous ride providers such as Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo.

Waymo began offering driverless service more broadly in major markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles last year, and has partnered exclusively with Uber to offer those rides in Austin starting this month. The two companies have a similar agreement to launch driverless trips in Atlanta this summer.

When Lyft launches its first driverless trips, it will be through existing partnerships, including with Toyota Motor Corp.-backed startup May Mobility in Atlanta.

Lyft shares have declined 9% since the start of the year, while Uber’s have gained 23% so far.

Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has gone so far as to predict that human drivers will eventually be displaced as autonomous software develops superior driving skills over the next 15 to 20 years. The company has made some early efforts to help create new earnings opportunities for its network of gig workers, including piloting a Taskrabbit-like service where customers can hire people to complete various household tasks. It’s also recruiting coders and language experts to fuel its new AI data labeling business.

In his blog post, Lyft’s Bird stopped short of predicting when drivers might be displaced, instead saying that driverless cars will create new opportunities for drivers. That includes manual work required to service, maintain and charge the vehicles. These are “jobs for which drivers are well suited,” Bird added.

The industry will also need customer service workers to respond to unusual events during driverless rides. In Lyft’s case, 30% of the staff working in its fleet management unit Flexdrive are former or current Lyft drivers, Bird wrote.

The company has also proposed ways for drivers to find jobs in other industries, offering free training to enter the tech industry. CEO David Risher also recently announced a new feature that uses AI to generate a recommendation letter, which active drivers in good standing can share with potential employers.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-03-20 18:12:22,"Apple is reportedly losing $1 billion a year on its streaming service as churn levels increase Apple's (AAPL) streaming platform is losing a reported $1 billion a year as the company faces stiff competition and a more choosy consumer.

According to a report in the Information, Apple — which just shed around $700 billion as a result of Wall Street's latest tech rout — has consistently spent over $5 billion annually to beef up its content slate since launching in 2019. That number, though, dramatically decreased to just about $500 million last year, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment.

The update comes as many media giants have pulled back on spending in favor of profitability. More streaming platforms are cracking down on password sharers and have also bundled their respective offerings to prevent churn, or users abandoning their subscription plans.

Last year, Apple partnered with Netflix (NFLX) and Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) to launch a new bundle dubbed StreamSaver, exclusively available to Comcast broadband internet service customers for a cost of $15 a month. The monthly price of a solo Apple TV+ subscription currently sits at $9.99, although users can bundle Apple's streaming service with other Apple-related products like Apple Arcade and Apple News+.

It's unclear whether the recent bundles are helping.

According to data compiled by subscription analytics platform Antenna, Apple's streaming service had the highest churn percentage of all the major streaming platforms, with the exclusion of Starz, with 7% of users churning out of the service during the month of February, compared to just 2% of users for Netflix and 4% of users for Disney+.

Notably, Apple has adopted a strategy different from that of its competitors. For one, its content slate is more limited, although it does boast highly acclaimed titles, including award-winning series like ""Severance,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""Ted Lasso."" It was also the first streaming platform to take home an Oscar win for best picture (thanks to ""Coda"").

In total, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins, CEO Tim Cook said on the company's January earnings call.

Apple TV+ does not release subscriber figures, although analysts have pegged total users at anywhere from 30 million to 40 million. Compared to Netflix, which boasts over 300 million subscribers thanks to its substantial global presence, Apple TV+ does not have high penetration in emerging markets, which have become increasingly important drivers as streaming hits peak saturation levels in the US and Canada.

""Apple's streaming service never set out to be No. 1,"" Santosh Rao, head of research at Manhattan Venture Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance. ""Apple is good at the game that they play, but it's not a mass appeal game. They want to be the creative storytellers. They're more focused.""

In January, Apple reported first quarter earnings that showed all-time highs for services revenue, which includes sales from businesses like Apple TV+, along with the App Store and Apple Music. Revenue for the division climbed to $26.34 billion for the period, compared to $23.12 billion in the prior year.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-03-20 11:11:47,"EU may delay first counter-tariffs against U.S. to mid-April BRUSSELS, March 20 (Reuters) - The European Union could delay imposition of a first set of counter-measures against the United States over President Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs until mid-April, European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on Thursday.

The European Commission had proposed re-imposing tariffs on 4.5 billion euros ($4.9 billion) of U.S. products on April 1, followed by hitting a further 18 billion euros of U.S. goods on April 13.

""We are now considering to align the timing of the two sets of EU counter-measures so we can consult with member states on both lists simultaneously, and this would also give us extra time for negotiations with our American partners,"" Sefcovic told a hearing at the European Parliament.

The first set of EU counter-measures includes applying a 50% tariff on U.S. bourbon. Trump threatened to slap a 200% tariff on all wines and other alcoholic products coming from the EU if the bloc went ahead with this.

The Trump administration is also planning further tariffs on April 2.

French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou said on Sunday that the EU was probably mistaken in targeting American whiskey, while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni cautioned EU partners on Tuesday against escalating the trade dispute with the United States.

""I am not certain that responding to tariffs with more tariffs is necessarily a good deal,"" Meloni, who is close to Trump, said.",,reddit/wallstreetbets
2025-03-20 11:10:47,"US companies race to secure import tariff exemptions after Trump pause March 20 (Reuters) - Washington's temporary relief for import tariffs on goods covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has triggered a spike in US companies seeking exemption under the trade deal, industry experts said.

The White House slapped fresh 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico on March 5, but later announced that levies on goods covered under the USMCA would be delayed until April 2.

The USMCA grants preferential treatment to goods either sourced from or having a minimum percentage of value added in any of the three countries.

""We're seeing importers rush to become USMCA certified ... the risk is just too high not to,"" said Brian Riley, senior vice president of customs house brokerage at logistics firm GEODIS.

Some of the companies, mostly small businesses reliant on cross-border trade, are scrambling to verify if their products already qualify for exemptions.

At present, only 37.8% of imports from Canada and 48.9% from Mexico are eligible for duty-free status under the USMCA, an S&P Global Market Intelligence report showed.

To qualify, an importer must analyze the bill of materials - a list of all parts and materials used in a product - to determine if their goods meet requirements.

Mike Short, president of Global Forwarding at freight forwarder C.H. Robinson, said there was an increase of USMCA qualification and tariff classification requests even before the official announcement.

""Now that the official amendments are published, these requests have only increased, and we expect this trend to continue.""

Businesses earlier refrained from getting the certification due to its complexity and costs of meeting requirements, especially since their goods were already entering the U.S. duty free.

Even after certification, a company has to maintain detailed records for up to five years after import and ensure continued compliance.

""Companies are hedging their bets by becoming USMCA certified because what's to say the exemption may not continue after April 2? Or, if the exemption expires then, what if it returns in the near future?"" GEODIS' Riley said.

The uncertainty has prompted companies to overlook immediate cost-savings.

""If you are slapping 25-50% tariffs on everything, companies that never previously needed to are now forced to evaluate if this (USMCA certification) is an option,"" said Sung Choi, vice-president of product management at supply chain solutions provider e2open.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-03-20 09:41:06,"Stop or GO for GO?(grocery outlet) I need to make you all aware of Grocery Outlet (GO)

 I wanted to bring some awareness to grocery outlet. it seems like with the way the economy is turning, with a dozen eggs or a bag of m&ms sitting at 10$, Grocery Outlet is going to be the store people start paying attention to for the hot deals. 



Grocery Outlet is a rapidly growing discount supermarket located mostly on the west coast. They are a chain known for offering brand-name groceries and quality products at discounted prices. They operate using a unique opportunistic buying model, purchasing surplus inventory, discontinued products, and closeout deals from manufacturers and retailers, which allows them to give customers good deals on quality products. 

I do think that they are due for a breakout, despite the fact that their stock has been consistantly bearish over the last few years. 

#######

1. **Recession-Proof during pandemics: Grocery Outlet crushes it during economic downturns. During 2020 (yall know what happened ) they saw growth of up to 50% over the year. As inflation squeezes consumers, they flock to bargain stores.**

2. **Rapid Expansion Mode:** They've been opening new stores aggressively, strategically targeting suburban markets. New stores mean more market penetration, higher revenue, and stronger growth potential. Last year they opened 67 new stores, only closing 2.

3. Insider buying: Director Thomas Herman recently bought around 10,000 shares in open market transactions (Source: Yahoo Finance, SEC filings). Insider buying like this indicates strong belief in the stock's upward trajectory.

4. **Undervalued Against Competitors:** Still undervalued compared to places like Dollar General or Aldi, Grocery Outlet offers major upside potential. I do think that they have more room to go down in price, possibly leading to better buying opportunities over the next year or two. 

5. **Personal Shopper Experience:** Personally, I regularly shop at Grocery Outlet and consistently find high-quality foods and goods at great prices. The store constantly rotates new products every month, keeping the shopping experience fresh and exciting. It's a great option for people like me who don't already have lots of extra money but prefer to purchase quality goods at lower prices. I generally get a better vibe shopping at a place like grocery outlet vs other discount grocery stores. It feels like a normal shopping experience, unlike Aldis where they make you bag your own groceries. 

 I'm just curious why the stock doesn't seem to get all that much volume compared to other retailers. I'm thinking of buying Long calls, but I'm also waiting to see how the price fluctuates before entering into a position over the next few months, perhaps waiting until their next earning? I'm also wondering how recent tarrifs or supply chain issues would affect GOs viability long term. What do you guys think? I think it's a stock worth observing and dca over the next year or two, or buying into long calls at cheap prices.

2025-03-20 00:51:14,"'The arrival of the tariff inflation': Powell doesn't shy from linking trade to prices as Fed shifts forecasts Jerome Powell did not shy away from the impact of President Trump’s tariffs during a highly anticipated press conference Wednesday.

The Federal Reserve chairman said in no uncertain terms that Trump's trade agenda would be likely to drive up prices, even amid considerable uncertainty about exactly how much — and whether the price changes would be ""transitory.""

In just one example Wednesday afternoon during a question about price stability, Powell said that inflation had previously neared the Fed's key goal but now ""I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed.""

It was just one of numerous comments from the central banker that contrasted with past meetings where he often declined to weigh in on the topic in detail.

The remarks from Powell came after the Fed on Wednesday decided to hold interest rates steady and maintained a prediction of two rate cuts later this year.

What the central bank did change was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower). And those upward inflation adjustments, Powell said, are ""really due to the tariffs coming in.""

US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Monetary Policy Committee meeting, at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC on March 19, 2025. Powell said Wednesday that inflation has started to rise in part due to President Donald Trump\&#39;s tariffs, although stressing that it is tough to isolate the effects of levies on price increases. 

Some analysts raised questions about the Fed's unchanged overall prediction of two cuts this year even as Trump's trade policy has roiled markets and cut back projections of economic growth for the remainder of the year.

""We continue to think that Fed officials are underestimating the extent to which tariffs are likely to push up inflation,"" Capitol Economics said in a note immediately after Wednesday's decision but before the press conference.

Trump has already levied new duties on China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as on steel and aluminum in his first months in office, with a key deadline on April 2 threatening reciprocal tariffs that could be historic in their breadth and scope.

**A potential for 'transitory' tariff inflation**

At other points in his press conference Wednesday, Powell also repeatedly said that the exact effects of tariffs on prices were uncertain, may never be exactly known, and could even be temporary.

He called the price effects of tariffs potentially ""transitory"" — reusing a much-scrutinized word that was deployed by the Fed and other economic officials in 2021 as prices started to rise during Joe Biden's presidency.

Powell then called a transitory effect on prices ""kind of the base case but we really can't know that"" as he maintained the Fed's long-held wait-and-see approach to actually responding to Trump's still unfolding economic agenda.

But the use of the loaded word also led to some immediate critiques.

Mohamed A. El-Erian, the president of Queens' College, quickly posted, ""I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility.""

The centrality of tariffs also led to critiques from Democrats.

Daniel Hornung, deputy director of the National Economic Council under Joe Biden, said in a statement that the changed projections are ""all about tariffs and policy uncertainty,"" adding that ""these are the major factors standing in the way of interest rates coming down.""

Powell's acknowledgments Wednesday contrasted past Fed meetings, where Powell often made clear that Trump's incoming policies were on his mind without going into much detail on whether a new round of tariffs would cause inflation.

In one moment last December, Powell held up a September 2018 ""Tealbook"" simulation on tariffs and prices and called them ""a good starting point"" but declined to weigh in much further on then-President-elect Trump's policies.

At the Fed's last meeting in January, just days after Trump's inauguration, the committee noticeably removed language about inflation making progress toward its 2% inflation goal.

This time around, Powell was clear he viewed the tariffs as a headwind against his efforts to get inflation to its 2% target but maintained confidence that the central bank could handle it.

2025-03-19 22:28:58,"What's TSLA worth in a fire sale? Occasionally, I see people suggest TSLA could go to $0. Obviously, any company can go to $0 if it's mismanaged for long enough, so sure, TSLA could go to $0. But some people have explicitly claimed that TSLA is basically a dead man walking, and could go to $0 any day now. This seems wrong, and it's kind of become a pet peeve for me.  
  
But what's the right answer? What's TSLA worth if tomorrow Elon Musk has a psychotic break tomorrow and is filmed running naked through the National Mall, a la the Kony 2012 guy?

Tesla's [most recent annual financial statement](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings) lists a ""stockholder's equity"" also known as book value, of $72.913 billion. Divide by 3.22 billion shares and you get the [reported of book value per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics/) $22.67. (My calculator says $22.64 but I assume that's a rounding error.)

That $72.913 billion book value comes from $122.070 billion in assets, including $58.360 billion in ""current assets"", less $48.390 billion in liabilities. Now according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_asset):

>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period.

If you look at the details of the balance sheet, the current assets are mostly stuff that would retain its value pretty well in a disaster, stuff like ""cash"" and ""short-term investments"". Strictly speaking if TSLA is holding a one-year bond its value on March 19th might be more or less than it was worth on December 31st, but assuming the value is unchanged isn't the worst assumption. The big exception, AFAICT, is ""inventory"", of which the balance sheet shows $12.017 billion.

Now, if you assume that when TMZ posts that naked Elon Musk video, all Tesla's inventory and all its non-current assets become worthless, yeah that bankrupts the company. But that's pretty clearly a bad assumption. The inventory might have to be marked down, but to $0? Maybe no hypothetical acquirer wants a Cybertruck factory, but factories can be retooled. Placing a market sell for Tesla's $1.076 billion worth of crypto might not return much cash, but presumably an acquirer wouldn't be that stupid. And I'm not an accountant, but ""deferred tax assets"" (valued at $6.524 billion) sound like something an acquirer might value at close to par?

So maybe we mark down Tesla's inventory by half (\~$6.009 billion); we mark down its crypto, which is overwhelmingly Bitcoin, based on how much Bitcoin has declined since December 31st (\~$0.078 billion), and we mark down other non-current assets (excepting deferred tax assets) by half (\~$28.133 billion), which gives us a fire sale value of about $38.69 billion or about $12/share.

I'm a software engineer, not an accountant or investment banker, so someone with more expertise in fundamentals analysis than I could probably come up with a better estimate than $12/share. But the fact remains you probably shouldn't place any bets that depend on TSLA going to $0 by end of next week.

Even though, yeah, fuck Elon.

Anyway, here's my position, which I'm holding today's movement be damned:

""Unless the tariff and non-tariff barriers are equalized, or the U.S. has higher tariffs, the tariffs will go into effect,"" the White House official said.Bessent told Fox Business Network's ""Mornings with Maria"" program that Trump on April 2 would give trading partner countries a [reciprocal tariff](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-reciprocal-tariffs-coming-thursday-2025-02-13/) number that reflects their own rates, non-tariff trade barriers, currency practice and other factors, but could negotiate to avoid a ""tariff wall.""""On April 2, each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs,"" Bessent said. ""For some countries, it could be quite low, for some countries, it could be quite high.""""We are going to go to them and say, 'Look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labor suppression, and if you will stop this, we will not put up the tariff wall,'"" Bessent said of trading partners.""I'm optimistic that (on) April 2, some of the tariffs may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated, or that once countries receive their reciprocal tariff number, that right after that they will come to us and want to negotiate it down,"" Bessent said.Countries that fail to reduce their trade barriers will face [steeper tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/tariffs/) aimed at protecting the U.S. economy, its workers and industries, Bessent added.His remarks were taken to mean that while the proposed duties would be announced on April 2, their implementation could be delayed to allow time for negotiations. But the White House official said any such deals would need to be negotiated in advance to avoid the new tariffs.

# DETAILED WORK

The dueling comments illustrate the developing nature of Trump's new reciprocal tariffs just two weeks out from the April 2 activation deadline.Details of the plan are still being worked out, one White House official said, with much of the technical work on the expected tariffs being led by the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, headed by Jamieson Greer, and his staff of some 200 people at USTR.Vice President JD Vance has also played a more active role in the discussions in recent weeks, the official said.A spokesperson for USTR did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reciprocal tariff plan.Greer and his staff have been wrestling with how to design the reciprocal tariffs given each of the 186 members of the World Customs Organization has different duty rates, sources familiar with the process said.Calculating the tariff rates is complicated by Trump's vow to reflect the impact of non-tariff barriers, including taxes and other measures that U.S. officials argue give other countries’ firms an unfair advantage.At the Commerce and Treasury departments, political appointees have also run into hiring delays linked to vetting, which has created some negotiating bottlenecks, the same sources familiar with the process said.Financial markets have become increasingly nervous about the impact of Trump's tariffs and retaliation from trading partners will have on inflation and economic growth. U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision on Wednesday.

# TRIGGERING TALKS

The Trump administration expects the tariff announcements to trigger offers by affected countries to reduce their own tariffs or non-tariff measures, the official said, noting that India, for one, was already trying to get ahead of the U.S. moves.After Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-says-trump-has-clear-roadmap-second-term-2025-03-17/) and Trump met last month, the two nations agreed to resolve tariff rows and work on the first segment of a deal by the fall of 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade of $500 billion by 2030.

Trump often singles out India as the country with the highest average tariff rates, among top trading partners, while European Union countries are criticized for their high 10% car tariff rate, which is four times the 2.5% U.S. passenger car rate, but less than the 25% U.S. tariff on pickup trucks.Bessent said that the Trump administration is particularly focused on the 15% of countries that have the highest tariffs and large trading volumes with the U.S., which he referred to as the ""Dirty 15.""These countries also often have regulations governing domestic content or food safety that conspire to keep U.S. products out of their markets, he said.British business and trade minister Jonathan Reynolds came to Washington this week to meet in person with Lutnick and Greer, with both sides talking up the prospects of a bilateral trade deal focused on technology.Summary

# Introduction

Fellow regards, I’m sure we are all aware that the all Powell-ful Jerome will be determining, at the Fed meeting today, how hard a fucking our significant other’s boyfriend will be pumping out. Yet fewer have discussed what move they will be making based on this situation. My thesis is simple - the market has mispriced the chance of a rate cut, underestimating it, and so to take advantage of that, I have am in a long TLT position - a highly-leveragable, long-term government bond ETF. I’ll first explain why I think there’s a higher chance of a rate slash than the market is telling us, specifically diving into why the market has been mispriced. I’ll then move onto why this will cause TLT to rise, and also why I’ve chosen TLT over other related assets.

# Why an interest rate cut seems likely to me

Let’s start with some basic economics. Modern monetary theory suggests that the FED uses interest rate hikes to lower inflation at the cost of weakening the economy (raising unemployment), while cuts strengthen the economy while causing inflation. Here's how our situation looks to me:

First, consider inflation. To be completely honest, I have been working on this thesis since before the release of CPI data for February - personally, I expected annual inflation, from January to February, to fall from 3% to 2.9%. So, I waited until March 10th for a bit of confirmation bias. I was greeted by:

[Fig 1.1. CPI for February 2025, all goods](https://preview.redd.it/hr2m6snl1npe1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=30e0d3b370fff5664846a1fc00fcf019370518e0)

[Fig 1.2. 12-month inflation of February 2025, all goods](https://preview.redd.it/58duajjt1npe1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=7504887c1cdb54bb6655364ac732cd031b5fb310)

Inflation has retreated more than expected, falling to 2.8%. One of the many reasons why an interest rate cut initially seemed unlikely was  due to concerns of sticky inflation - this has provided evidence that inflation is falling. Granted, fed changes are not instant, and I’ll address fears regarding inflation later on in more detail. However, this data has shown us that inflation isn't as bad as we thought it'd be, and seems to be falling - evidence in favour of a rate cut happening. 

On the other hand, the economy:

[Fig 2.1. Consumer sentiment data](https://preview.redd.it/j9khkay22npe1.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=3844b51954a3e6f01801e10ba3334e014d3d6713)

Consumer sentiment has completely crashed, falling 10% from Febuary to March, with expectations showing an even bleaker result

[Fig 2.2. Consumer spending falls in January 2025](https://preview.redd.it/dp7hgvg82npe1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=abc1d6630a4380931629607fe431db721b62a781)

Actual spending has also fallen - for the first time in a long time, people are spending less, despite easing inflation. And while preliminary data has appeared for February showing consumer spending has gone back up by 0.2%, this is still underperforming expectations. A weak consumer base, unwilling to spend, is never a good sign.

[Fig 2.3. ISM Manufacturing - PMI Index](https://preview.redd.it/cwzyk03j2npe1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0197772d801cd7f15e9f317e79c0199b0fb163d)

[Fig 2.4. A more detailed look at the index](https://preview.redd.it/eg6p861q2npe1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=9137514ca9dc0db417be1cd38bf9252c809451a0)

The manufacturing index has also seen better days. The manufacturing PMI has fallen from 50.9 to 50.3 in February. Now, in all fairness, this still means there is growth - any score above 50 indicates expansion - however, it means that growth is slowing down and seems to be at an inflection point, where it’ll start contracting again. Looking at the specifics, we also see details that show new orders and employment numbers are contracting, production and exports are seeing reduced growth, all while imports are growing at an accelerated pace. None of these show the signs of a confident economy. But perhaps most important to us degenerates, the stock market worries:

[Fig 2.5. Trillions wiped off the stock market in the last 2 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/0mndpd1v2npe1.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0a513492d726a76f2b3c57b054ac238b7e89f8f)

I’m sure all of us remember last week, when our portfolios got bent over by trump refusing to rule out a recession. A recession. I don’t think it can be spelled out any clearer to even the passengers of the shortest of buses - Trump does not seem to mind, and in fact is open accepting of recession

[Fig 2.6. Google searches for recession surging](https://preview.redd.it/5xev3p0w3npe1.png?width=2338&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f642682041e45ebcd926105b0be2647892d509)

Another decent indicator of recession is also the number of google searches you see for it - clearly, we're amidst another breakout.

[Fig 2.7. Holy fucking shit](https://preview.redd.it/v6p7emz44npe1.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea9eae8a32a16633f308444716a58e680b97de93)

The long and short of it is that it’s not looking good. Crashing consumer expectations, cratering stock prices, manufacturing slowdowns - they all paint the picture of a recession coming up. Thus, with inflation not too bad, I believe that the FED should prioritise bringing back economic growth over keeping inflation down.

# A mispricing in the market

So, given the sorry state of our economy and comparatively better inflation control, you'd expect the market to price the chance of an interest rate cut at 40%, maybe 20%, maybe very low end, 5%. In reality...

1 per cent

According to a popular betting market, there is just a 1% chance Powell will change the interest rate today. Now of course, the betting market does not automatically correspond to what the stock market is thinking - however, any investor that sees an obvious arbitrage opportunity like this would be able to make a 100-fold return against tens of millions of dollars of liquidity if the stock market disagreed, so it seems to me that this accurately reflects the general sentiment.

Here's the most important part of my DD that I want to emphasise. In fact, if there’s any takeaway from my DD, let it be this:

I am **not** telling you Jerome will definitely cut rates tomorrow. In fact, anyone claiming to know for sure what Jerome will do tomorrow either has inside information, is lying, or is grossly misinformed. The first group will never talk to the likes of us, the second group is taking advantage of the likes of us, and the third group belongs among the likes of us. 

No, all my DD hinges upon is the idea that the chance of an interest rate cut is higher than 1%. That’s all you need - the thought that interest rate cuts aren't being priced in correctly, and that’s where any real money is made - mispricings in the market. I personally don’t see how the chance of an interest rate cut is not higher than 5% - if your takeaway from my analysis is that it will be anything above 1%, you too believe, there is a mispricing in the market, and can profit from purchasing TLT. 

So this begs the question of why there's a market mispricing

# Why is there a mispricing / “But you’re forgetting about…”

There are a couple ideas that people can bring up to suggest why interest rate cuts are unlikely - I’ll try and cover the main ones and deliver a rebuttal on all of them.

Firstly, there’s concern of inflation from Trump’s tariffs. This is not unfounded - tariffs are inflationary, and perhaps the worry of inflation is too great to cut rates. Firstly, I’d like to point out that many of Trump’s other policies are deflationary: deregulation and government spending cuts are both deflationary, and I don’t think we truly realise how likely “tail-end events” like cutting half of military spending is with an unpredictable guy like Trump - he’s discussed it before. Secondly, Jerome Powell himself has stated, at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business on March 7th, that tariffs may cause a one off price hike, but that “longer-term expectations remain stable and consistent with our 2% inflation goal”. A one-off rise in inflation will not need to be adjusted for - as Powell correctly ascertains, policies should only deal with persistent inflation.

Secondly, some will mention that Powell himself has said before that it is not in a hurry to cut interest rates. I will point out that these quotes are all from before March 10th, before Trump refused to rule out the chance of a recession, before the stock market plummeted and lost trillions of dollars, and before we saw consumer confidence sour so drastically. The situation has changed, and Powell is now much more likely to slash rates.

Finally, the previous point already alludes to this, but one idea is that there’s a conflict between Trump and Powell, in the way that Trump is almost trying to cause economic panic to force Powell into lowering interest rates. People will have you believe that big J, in an attempt to win this dick-swinging contest, will refuse to back down and keep interest rates constant. Maybe, maybe, but what's more important than winning the measuring contest is preventing the ruin that will come to millions if we fail to cushion economic downturn. Jerome does not want to be the guy who failed to do enough and saw America go through a recession or worse. In fact, I’ll go so far as to say the opposite - I think Powell is likely to fold now due to his past expereince. Many criticisms have been levelled against the man on account of the fact that he didn’t hike rates early enough in 2021, which led to out-of-control inflation. I think that it’s likely that he has learned from this mistake, and I’d err on him acting sooner rather than later on cutting rates.

Most important to keep in mind however, is that maybe you still have doubts about if Jerome is likely to cut interest rates. Keep in mind - we’re not asking if it’s more likely he’ll cut rates or keep them the same. We’re asking if the market is mispriced - if the chance he’ll cut rates is higher than 1%. Any bit of edge is a bullish indication for TLT.

# Ok, I think the chance of a cut is higher than 1%. How do I make money off that

Minimising risk. It's arguably the one of the core tenets of the stock market - the idea of a net worth rising in a safe and predictable straight line is tantalising to all but the most degenerate regard. It's why so many rich people are willing to take a below-market return from a hedge fund - there's a team of brilliant Asian quants out there who, instead of curing cancer or perfecting interplanetary travel, are creating the most ridiculous and incomprehensible financial products to tame risky and volatile assets into neat little beta neutral, uncorrelated returns that beat the risk free rate by half a percent, all for the price of a 2/20 fee structure. There's money to be made in lowering risk.

However, you’re in the wrong subreddit if you’re that brilliant Asian quant. As such, we’ll be doing the opposite - taking the safest investment in the world - US treasury bonds, and jacking it up to the tits in leverage to increase risk, in return for enlarged profits.

Firstly, treasury bonds are the asset of choice because I think that they will have the largest quick movement due to this mispricing in the market. Stock markets react unpredictably to interest rate movements - bonds do not. For those who don’t know, when interest rates fall, all new government bonds issued have lower coupon rates. As such, the old government bonds, with comparatively higher coupon rates, rise in value. This is why “government bonds rise in value when rates are cut, and vice versa”. This is even more so for long-term treasury bonds compared to short-term bills - since the coupon is paid out many more times, the rise in value is exaggerated too.

The liquid variety for long-term treasury bonds is the TLT, an ETF that tracks the bond price. Not only is the liquidity a plus, but the asset being an ETF allows you to buy options on it, letting you purchase different calls until you are sufficiently leveraged for your personal risk tolerance.

Unfortunately, I’m a broke ass college student who has an evil, satanic, institutional broker that doesn't allow me to buy options. So, I’ve spent about half my money on TLT shares. 

[My 50 shares of TLT](https://preview.redd.it/tbh4scdn6npe1.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=82ee7bedc1831d8ef90a20c15b062fcedfd5121a)

# What Next

Now, of course, I don’t know for sure if Jerome will cut rates. Here are my rough plans based on what happens next:

1. Rates get cut:

I’d expect TLT to rise sharply, due to the market not expecting this cut. Happy days. Probably sell and throw the money into a global fund, or maybe hold onto the position, anticipating more cuts throughout the year.

2. Rates don’t move:

Then in this case, TLT probably won’t move significantly, since the market is pretty much expecting this outcome. I’d probably hold onto my position a bit longer, since if he’s not cutting now, he needs to cut by May. This would also probably give me a generally bearish attitude on the US economy and stocks - I think this would be cutting rates a little too late. Probably start throwing more of my money into bonds and international markets.

Either way, I think that this mispricing in the market can be capitalised on. Good luck regards!

tl;dr - Due to a weak economy, I think there’s a higher than 1% chance rates will be cut (the market prediction), therefore, the markets have priced TLT too low",,reddit/wallstreetbets

Outstanding question: is the healthcare system ready for curative one-time therapies, as compared to daily or weekly treatments.

*My position:*

[Adding more on dips](https://preview.redd.it/5if8gtja9jpe1.png?width=2156&format=png&auto=webp&s=308e2ceb065c32bcc0f5a67050baa8e65715c77e)

**Background**

CRSP is a company developing medicine for genetic diseases using CRISPR gene editing technology. The scientists who discovered this technology won the Nobel Prize in 2020. CRSP has one marketed product, Casgvey, that was developed via a collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals to treat sickle cell disease. They have a profit sharing arrangement, which entitles them to 40% of all profits from Casgevy, while Vertex manages the commercialization. This is great because they have a built-up commercial team which has shown success at getting reimbursement from insurance and getting doctors to prescribe expensive treatments.

The CEO says that they hope to be $100B biotech one day!!

\*\*Financials (\*\*As of 3/18/2025)

Market Cap = $3.67B; Enterprise Value = $1.8B

Net Cash = $1.9B

Short interest = 24.7% of the float (significant short squeeze potential)

\~70% Institutional Investors (Smart Money)

They have an average operating expenses of \~$130M/quarter, so absent any revenue from Casgevy we can expect them to have funding to last at least the next three years and by then it is highly likely that there will be significant profits from Casgevy. This means that at the very least the dilution risk very low, which is common among pre-revenue biotech companies and is the main reason why they are often heavily shorted.

**Macro**

Rate cut/growth scare means biotech boom.

**Commercial Success**

The CEO has said that there is tremendous patient interest in the therapy, and more will be convinced as additional long-term safety data is generated. CEO also says that they are currently ramping up approved treatments center - both the number of centers and how many patients each can treat.

Several analysts have projected that Casgevy could reach $1B in sales as of 2026 and reach peak sales of $3.5B in 2030, per typical drug sales ramps. As EOY24 there are 50 patients undergoing the Casgevy therapy process, as more treatment centers continue to open. This therapy costs $2.2M and these 50 patients equate to sales of $110 million, but it is unknown when that will be collected and if that is enough for profit to begin flowing to CRSP. It only takes a few dozen patients to be treated for this therapy to yield serious revenue, for example, that $1B target equates to 450 patients being treated, out of a US patient pool of around 30k, who are healthy enough to receive the treatment and have access through insurance. However, this can’t continue forever and once you treat all the available patients, you are only able to treat this disease at the incidence rate (# of babies born with sickle cell) but remember that if Casgevy treats only half of that 30k patient population, it will have made over $33B.

Recently there has been significant process at negotiating access for this therapy on both Medicare/Medicaid and private insurance companies. The consensus insurance approach is outcomes-based agreements (OBA), which would tie a portion of the payments to how well the treatment provide clinical benefit to patients ([Link](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/innovation-models/cgt)). This is critical in providing access to patients and increasing commercial uptake.

Now let’s take a look at my NPV projections based on the analyst estimates above.

Projected NPV of $6B, considering the enterprise value of $1.8B, this implies upside of \~233% or a share price of \~$132. For reference the average analyst price target is \~$77.

**Assumptions**

|| || |·      Assumes 50% FCF margin| |·      Discount rate of 12%| |·      Perpetual growth of 3% (very conservative, given pipeline)| |·      40% profit sharing in Casgevy| |·      Peak sales for Casgevy in 2030 estimated to be $3.5B| |·      Only values company on Casgevy  |

**Competitors**

There is one other gene edit therapy in sickle cell develop by BlueBird, but they essentially just went bankrupt and sold to a private equity for pennies [(Press Release Link)](https://investor.bluebirdbio.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bluebird-bio-announces-definitive-agreement-be-acquired-carlyle). Not to mention their therapy also has a black box warning for hematological malignancies, which is the kiss of death for therapies where there is a suitable alternative. Who would want to risk getting cancer?  Their therapy also costs $1M more than Casgevy.

Since traditional medicine aka the previous standard of care only addressed the symptoms of sickle cell, we expect almost no competition from the current market landscape. 

There are likely to be several similar therapies from other gene editing competitor coming to market in the next 3-5 years, but the first-to-market usually secures a solid market share.

**Clinical Pipeline**

CRSP also has a solid extensive pipeline of moderately de-risked assets in development. CEO says that commercial success in Casgevy will fund them to make strategic bets to fill their pipeline with 1-2 new drugs per year.

·      **CTX310; CTX320** = Two candidates in vivo liver editing programs targeting LPA and ANGPTL3, which expects data to be release in 1H 2025 (recent presentations suggest between early April and early May). The CEO stated that they will benefit from economies of scale. The first program in their liver editing platform will cost \~$100M and each subsequent one will only cost $15M to develop because it’s a modular platform.

·      **CTX112; CTX131** = Two allogenic CAR-T cell therapy candidates targeting CD19 and CD70, which expect data to be released in mid-2025 and Q4 2025, respectively. Low COGS on allogenic CAR-Ts make them a very attractive business model, even if clinical data is only OK. AstraZeneca reached paid $1B for EsoBiotec, an allogenic CAR-T platform that is in the clinic. ([Link](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-buy-esobiotec-upto-1-billion-2025-03-17/))

·      **VCTX210; VCTX211** = Two regenerative medicine cell therapy replacement candidates for Type 1 Diabetes, which expects an update in 2H 2025. We should be cautious about expecting much from this because their partner, Vertex, has opted out of ownership and we do not know if that is because they plan to focus on their own cell therapy replacement or if something went wrong in the trial.  CEO seemed upbeat about it in a recent presentation.

It's also important to note that CRSP wholly owns all the clinical programs above, so contrary to Casgevy, they will receive 100% of the profits. Feel free to look at their [pipeline](https://crisprtx.com/pipeline) for more in depth analysis, but that is not the focus of this research.  There are also several pre-clinical programs, but those will materially affect the stock price in my view because they are about *at least* 6 years from revenue generation.

**Risks**

·      Patients may not want to go through the cell depletion conditioning process required for this treatment - it is like chemotherapy.

·      Insurance companies may not want to pay for the high price tag of Casgevy ($2.2M), despite the long term clinical and cost benefits. Developing gene editing medicines is not a validated and proven business model (very different economics from small molecules and biologics)

·      Safety Risks. Unknown new clinical data could come out which suggests that there are risks associated with CRISPR based medicine compared to more novel and targeted gene editing approaches like base editing or prime editing. Not sure what these would be, but it’s definitely possible.

·     Efficacy Risks. Any of the their clinical programs might not generate enough efficacy to beat standard of care (however it is widely accepted that precision medicine companies have significantly higher success rates).

·      Competitors still in the clinic could deliver better data that would be the new standard of care in sickle cell, which limits long term growths for Casgevy

2025-03-18 23:08:58,"Will Bitcoin Burn Everyone This Time? MicroStrategy has accumulated nearly 500,000 BTC, but they are now slowing down their purchases. If they start liquidating strategically, they could crash Bitcoin without anyone noticing until it's too late.

Imagine the perfect play:

They sell slowly OTC to avoid scaring the market.

Meanwhile, they short BTC with leverage to maximize profits.

Once support breaks, they dump everything, triggering liquidations.

Bitcoin crashes below 30k, ETFs see massive outflows, and they cash in billions.


If BTC no longer grows exponentially, MicroStrategy is trapped. They either exit now with a profit or risk imploding with the asset. And if they decide to sell, we could witness the biggest Big Short in crypto history.

Too paranoid or a plausible scenario?

P.S. This strategy is known as ""sell against the box"" — a classic risk management tactic used by institutional investors.
It allows an entity to hedge their long position by shorting the same asset, locking in profits without ever selling directly.

By doing this, MicroStrategy could simply drain the market's volatility, generate liquidity, and accumulate even more BTC — all while maintaining a fully bullish narrative and never letting the public see a single direct sale.

2025-03-18 22:54:27,"What to look for in FED meeting tomorrow 3/19 **Jerome Powell's Speech:** Don't be too concerned with Jerome Powell's speech tomorrow, because it will most likely be a copy of his speech from a week ago at the press conference. The market rallied over 1% on that speech as Jerome Powell tried to calm the markets. Mostly consisted of ""wait and see"" and ""the data is still fine"". The truth is we had a decent CPI and Jobs read for Feb, and PMI and consumer Sentiment were mediocre. The Fed simply cannot make a drastic stance on cuts or the economy this early without sufficient data.

**Dot Plot:** The most important thing to look for in the FOMC meeting tomorrow is the brand new revised dot plot. Every major investment bank along with CME Fed watch has their current predictions on rate cuts for 2025 at 2-3 cuts (leaning more towards 3). If we see the 19 members of the fed come out tomorrow and say they disagree with that, and we are more likely to stay with 2 cuts for 2025, we could see a sharp repricing down, as rate cuts are very bullish for the equities market. (you are going to want to see more dots shift down to the line right above 3.5)

[Dec 2024 Dot Plot](https://preview.redd.it/5nidotlj2jpe1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=4262ada3bd7032b9e81342eebc1ab8f30fdd4151)

**Summary of Economic Projections:** Lastly is if the Fed will project a lower GDP then in there last prediction in December. They currently have it at 2.1% for 2025, which was raised from Sept 2024's prediction of 2.0%. But also note they increased their inflation metrics heavily in December.

https://preview.redd.it/yjiz1afp2jpe1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c35aa479d40f066919285c8272ab43606015ff

Dec 2024 Projections

The last summary of projections was a sharp change to inflation reigniting due to their cuts, but also that GDP and Unemployment would improve slightly as a result. With new fiscal policies causing fears that we wont get those improvement in GDP or Unemployment, it really puts the Fed in a tough place where these new projections for March almost seem certain to be downgrades.

[GDP 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/yc5hpmu42jpe1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6d1932796db56357111549000d6f577c926191b)

The other thing to note is that the 2025 GDP projections have the widest distribution of all their 2025 projections. Meaning that the fed members are the most split or undecided on this decision, and that the new data could potentially really swing those numbers down. Opposed to unemployment where 14 of 19 Fed members all picked 4.3% for 2025, and are less likely to all be swayed or moved.

[Unemployment 2025 Projections](https://preview.redd.it/i3xbsfs82jpe1.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0277eed836fe102e11c728f263d4ce3e0c1d205)

**Summary:** I personally believe we will get sharp adjustments down to GDP and slightly up to unemployment, while inflation will stay close to the same (maybe lowered a little). If this isn't met with the Dot Plot increasing the Fed's stance from 2 to 3 cuts for 2025 (I have no prediction for this as there are so many factors), expect more short term pain in the markets as investment banks downgrade and reprice assets down.",,reddit/wallstreetbets

2025-03-18 20:34:54,"Could Nvidia's valuation be set to be redefined after GTC? NVIDIA (NVDA) is basically the big cheese in the GPU and AI computing world. Here's the lowdown:

* **Consumer GPUs**: Think gaming rigs, content creators, and PC enthusiasts.
* **Data Centers & AI**: Powering massive AI workloads, cloud services, and enterprise data centers.
* **Self-Driving & Robotics**: Venturing into autonomous vehicles, robotics, and edge computing.

**Financials: Show Me the Money**

Let's dive into NVIDIA's financials over the past five years. Spoiler: It's been a wild ride.

|Fiscal Year|Revenue ($B)|Net Income ($B)|EPS ($)|Gross Margin (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021|16.7|4.3|1.47|62|
|2022|26.9|9.8|3.37|65|
|2023|27.0|10.2|3.55|66|
|2024|30.0|11.5|4.00|67|
|2025\*|35.0|13.0|4.50|68|

\*2025 numbers are guesstimates, so don't @ me if they're off.

**Breaking It Down:**

* **Revenue**: Climbing like a SpaceX rocket, thanks to data centers and AI.
* **Net Income & EPS**: Also on the up and up, showing they're not just making it rain but also stacking those Benjamins efficiently.
* **Gross Margin**: From 62% to an estimated 68%—that's some serious cheddar, indicating their products are top-shelf.

**Product Highlights: What's Cooking?**

* **Blackwell Ultra Series**: Dropping later this year, these AI chips (B300/GB300) are beefed up with 288GB memory (up from 192GB) and a 50% performance boost. Data centers are drooling.
* **Full-Stack AI Solutions**: NVIDIA's building an AI empire, making it easier for cloud providers and businesses to hop on their bandwagon and save some coin.
* **Self-Driving & Robotics**: They're not just about GPUs; they're diving into autonomous vehicles and robots, keeping things futuristic.

**GTC 2025: The Hype Is Real**

* **Event Deets**: On March 18 in San Jose, NVIDIA's annual GTC shindig is the place to be for devs, investors, and media folks. Expect AI, robotics, data centers, and self-driving car talk, plus the scoop on Blackwell Ultra chips and the next-gen Rubin GPU architecture.
* **Market Vibes**: Tickets are hotter than a summer in Phoenix, but NVDA stock dipped \~1.76% pre-event. Investors might be biting their nails over production and yield concerns.
* **Catalyst Watch**: Analysts say if NVIDIA clears the air on production and performance at GTC, we could see a stock rally. If not, expect some market side-eye until the next earnings drop.

**6-Month Stock Forecast: Crystal Ball Time**

* **Bearish Scenario**: If new products flop or GTC is a snooze, stock might chill around $120.
* **Bullish Scenario**: If GTC delivers and NVIDIA squashes production fears, we could see $150 or more.
* **Overall Range**: Expect NVDA to dance between $120 and $150 in the next six months.

**Investment Take: To the Moon?**

* **Hold & HODL**: Most analysts are saying ""buy"" or ""hold,"" betting on NVIDIA's long-term game in AI, data centers, and self-driving tech.
* **DCA FTW**: Given possible short-term jitters post-GTC, consider dollar-cost averaging. Keep an eye on upcoming earnings and product launches.

**Risk Factors: Watch Your Six**

* **Production & Supply Chain**: If the new chips hit snags, short-term profits could take a hit.
* **Competition**: AMD, Intel, and other up-and-comers aren't sleeping; they want a piece of NVIDIA's pie.
* **Macro & Geopolitical**: Global economic hiccups, trade wars, or export bans could rain on NVIDIA's parade.
* **Tech & Product Risks**: If GTC doesn't wow or new products disappoint, investor enthusiasm might fizzle, leading to stock dips.

**TL;DR**

NVIDIA's killing it in the GPU and AI arena, with solid financials and exciting product launches on deck. GTC 2025 is the next big thing to watch. Short-term, the stock might wobble, but long-term prospects look juicy. Keep an eye on competition and global shenanigans, but overall, NVIDIA seems poised for more win.

2025-03-18 19:16:09,"Can Newly Released NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software Save NVIDIA's Stock? First we need to know what the NVIDIA Dynamo Open Source Reasoning Software is for.



The above description comprehensively summarizes the main functions and application scenarios of NVIDIA Dynamo, as well as the revolutionary impact it may have on AI inference and its long-term positive effect on the company’s stock price. Specifically:



Software Functions and Application Scenarios



Intelligent Scheduling and Resource Allocation: Dynamo not only inherits the advantages of the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server but also goes further by dynamically allocating GPU resources to cope with fluctuating inference request volumes, ensuring that each GPU operates at high efficiency even under heavy load.

Optimizing Large Language Model Inference: It adopts a decomposed service strategy, distributing the processing and generation stages of large language models across multiple GPUs, which significantly improves throughput in practical applications. For example, when running the DeepSeek-R1 model on certain rack clusters, the number of tokens generated per GPU can be increased by approximately 30 times.

Multi-Framework Support and Expanded Use Cases: As an open-source software, Dynamo can support various frameworks including PyTorch and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, making it suitable for cloud service providers, data centers, and enterprise AI factories.

Revolutionary Significance



Innovation in Resource Utilization: By leveraging intelligent routing and dynamic allocation, Dynamo can double performance and revenue with the same hardware resources, fundamentally changing traditional inference deployment methods.

Building an Open-Source Ecosystem: Its open-source nature not only promotes standardization and innovation in distributed inference architectures but also fosters collaborative progress across the entire AI industry.

Enhancing Cost Efficiency and Performance: By reducing data transmission and storage costs as well as increasing GPU computational density, the software is expected to make AI services more efficient and cost-competitive.

Potential Impact on NVIDIA’s Stock Price In the long term, Dynamo is expected to help consolidate NVIDIA’s leadership in AI infrastructure, especially as the data center and cloud services segments continue to expand, thereby driving higher revenue and profit growth for the company. Although the market might remain cautious about the immediate results of the new product launch in the short term, the widespread adoption of this technology by more service providers is anticipated to have a positive effect on the stock price.



Why do I think NVIDIA Dynamo Open-Source Inference Software will have a positive impact on NVDA's stock price?

Because this software will substantially boost NVIDIA's revenue in data center and cloud services.



From the public earnings data and market expectations, NVIDIA's data center and cloud services business has shown an upward trend in recent years, but it should be noted that the proportion here is subject to quarterly fluctuations, especially in quarters driven by AI demand (e.g., in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, data center revenue once accounted for 90.5%)

[CN.INVESTING.COM](http://CN.INVESTING.COM)

), while the full-year average is much smoother. Estimates based on current public information and analysis:



FY2023: Data center and cloud services business will account for approximately 43% of total annual revenue.

FY2024: The market expects this to rise to around 50% or so, driven by continued strong AI demand.

FY2025: While some quarters (e.g. Q4) are particularly strong, on average for the year, the share of data center and cloud services is expected to stabilize between 50% and 55%.

2025-03-18 13:06:36,"A Guide to the Biggest ""IPO"" in History: trashy DD on FNMA and FMCC The guide to the biggest “IPO” in history

Hello my highly regarded denizens, and let me introduce you to the upcoming insanity that will be surrounding the release of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from the bowels of hell, government bureaucracy, and the OTC. I’m going to lead off with a few basic ways to play this, what kind of red flags I’ll be looking for, and some background and context in case you’re not familiar with this HIGHLY unusual situation.

First off, there are two securities you can buy here. The first are the common stock: FNMA and FMCC, for each of the companies. You need to think of these as call options with no theta and delta 1. I’m personally weighted heavily towards these since Inauguration but I’ll get more into that momentarily. Then there are the junior preferred shares, each of which correspond to one of the companies and usually share the first few letters: FNMAS, FNMAT, FNMAJ for Fannie, and FMCCH, FMCKJ, and FMCCO for Freddie. 

In case you’ve been living under a rock or are an active subscriber of The Motley Fool, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the two most profitable companies by employee, and have the largest assets on the face of fucking planet. That’s seven and a half TRILLION dollars in assets. They buy up mortgages from banks, dump ‘em together in a various pots called securitizations, and basically print money from the payments. Back in 08, the government made a determination based on secret filings that Fannie and Freddie were super dangerous, and would have to print their earnings directly into the Treasury department instead. At the head of this conservatorship, and controlling Fannie and Freddie is the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Currently, the US Treasury Department owns a million shares of the Senior Preferred Shares (SPS) at a value of around $200 billion. They ALSO own warrants, equal to diluting the common stock by 80%. The Treasury awarded themselves these shares and warrants after forcing Fannie and Freddie to take a loan out on hypothetical losses in 08, and there’s only three men who can do anything about that. Thankfully, they have a raging boner of hatred for the government.

Junior Preferred Shares (JPS) and commons are both available to common investors, but only through the OTC, so Robinhooders are in shambles (again). JPS are more protected but have capped upside; they have a par value (aka a cap in price) of either $25 or $50, and if dividends get turned on again (only after a release, covered below), they get up to 8% of par first, and then commons get the rest. There’s also a fun added bonus round just to make things more complex: JPS and Freddie commons (but not FNMA) will be getting damages awarded after the presiding judge decided to sign off (after waiting TWO years, and yes, you read that right). FMCKJ will be getting something like $3 in damages, and as of 3/17, was trading at $10. 

Then there’s common shares. High risk, ultra high reward. Depending on what kind of scenario plays out, we could see share price hitting anything from sub $2 if you believe somnambulant lawyers, to $34 if you believe Bill Ackman, to price targets that you wouldn’t fucking believe until I lay it all.

Right now, here’s the main events:

Relist: Currently commons and JPS languish in OTC purgatory. 20% pops and drops on zero news, zero halts, and lower liquidity than your mother in her memory care unit. Shambles. Rather than an IPO, the companies can follow a much simpler uplisting procedure to the NYSE This will allow institutions to buy who are restricted from OTC trading, as well as making positions marginable, including OPTIONS. Theoretically, they can uplist at any moment.
Recap: based on arbitrary regulations, Fannie and Freddie have to have some certain amount of money to backstop the loans they guarantee. How much you ask? It entirely depends on who’s in charge? Back when Mark Calabria was running things, they needed like 4.5% of their book as a reserve! Good thing that those capital requirements didn’t stop payments from running straight out of Fannie and Freddie’s wallet into untraceable Treasury accounts! The specific phrase you need to parsing Twitter headlines is “ECRF”, which stands for “Everybody Chill, Release Fannie,” letting you know that if the amount is 1.5%, Fannie will be released within a year (it’s just under the capital threshold). If it’s lower than 1.5%, Fannie can be released IMMEDIATELY. Freddie is a little slower, but he works just as hard you guys, and he won’t be far too far behind. 
Release: dividends get turned back on, justice is restored, and angelic choirs announce the golden age of America.

So let me give a couple of the RED FLAGS for free. If you see these, FLEE commons. 
Warrant Exercise. We know you’ve been trying hard to forget that reminder about your license being suspended, but this is definitely one warrant you can’t escape. Diluting the float by 80% would absolutely murder commons with no real hope of reprieve. Your only saving grace might be that OTC tends to trade headlines a day or two slow. 
SPS conversion. Just like a regular conversion, this one will also have you on your knees begging for mercy. Basically another form of dilution.
“Need for continued study.” You know how when you had that hot band chick over to study, and you kept trying to touch her hand while going over AP Calc homework, but she got angry that you weren’t paying enough attention to what SHE thought was important? This is like that. Without significant internal pressure, government impetus will stop any relist/recap/release movement simply out of being the fact that they’re collectively lazy and stupid. Given that midterms are going to be a distraction for decision makers only 15 months from now, progress needs to be made, and quickly, before GOP control of all three branches is threatened. Specifically, while some of these comments were made by Scott Bessent (now Treasury Secretary) and Bill Pulte (now FHFA Director), that was before they were confirmed, and based on everything I’m seeing, were statements to basically placate the committees. To get released, these companies will need specific and meaningful policy decisions.

Here’s what I’m IMAGINING for green flags. Seriously, there hasn’t been a lot of public statements made about these companies, but I think for good reasons, mainly political.
SPS CANCELLED. There’s several good reasons to believe the Treasury’s stock will just straight go to zero. First, the Treasury has been MORE than paid back on the loans they gave going back to 08; altogether, they got paid $340 billion over a $200 billion loan. This raises serious questions about why the government can simply continue to demand money from organizations it ‘conserves,’ which was one reason why a jury voted 8-0 to give damages in the Fairholme case. The continued existence of SPS brings into question the very notion of property rights in America.
Warrants to be sold. There’s a lot of speculation about what the Treasury would do with the warrants after a recap/relist. A popular theory is that the Treasury could gradually sell these assets off, and allocate the money to whatever pet project. This seems pretty likely, given talk about a Sovereign Wealth Fund, and similar procedures with confiscated bitcoins etc. There’s some interesting dynamics where warrants could be sold to fund a SWF, which funds real estate development, which pumps FnF, raising warrant values higher, etc.
Warrants to be CANCELLED. The ultimate bull case. If this happens, commons will launch to Mars and legends will be made. Some say the “government” would never go for this. I say the government is run by the same man who brought us TRUMPCOIN on Inauguration weekend, and we can’t even know if he has a position since filings on OTC are VOLUNTARY. Sure would be quite an ARTFUL DEAL if the decision maker about FHFA actions just so happened to have a position.

So where are we at with this?
Trump: a man with significant real estate holdings and a desire to eliminate government agencies wholesale.
Bessent: confirmed Treasury Secretary with a desire to privatize everything in sight.
Pulte: confirmed FHFA director, who on the first day, declared himself Chairman of the Board for FnF and cleared house on the board. 
At this point I’m basically just waiting for an announcement. It will probably come from Bessent who will declare something about having made an agreement with Pulte to wind down FHFA, but I wouldn’t put it past Trump to announce an executive order just ending it, a la USAID. There hasn’t been much specifically said, but there is a forest of legal red tape surrounding this thing. While there could be progress made on the legal front (final motion in Fairholme damages was finally dismissed after waiting two years, and the case still isn’t even certified!), this is ultimately a political question and it seems like all the stars have aligned. 

Positions: I've been selling JPS to capture some more volatility out of commons, I plan to rotate around a bit. 

""But you're already up a lot"" dipshit, tell me if it makes any sense for a $3 dividend to trade at $6. 

""You just want exit liquidity"" you just want to be able to breathe through your nose, but that doesn't stop you from buying BABA with less volume on the NYSE than EITHER Fannie or Freddie on the OTC.

2025-04-02 16:46:58,"CarParts.com (NASDAQ: PRTS) Special Situation **Summary**

[CarParts.com](http://CarParts.com) ($PRTS) recently announced that they are exploring a sale of the business to maximize value. Since the pop post-announcement, the stock has traded down >20% due to macro weakness and their Q4 earnings report. 

PRTS is an online after-market auto parts retailer focused on non-discretionary collision parts. While this is a commoditized industry, PRTS differentiates itself from competitors by owning its supply chain (most online retailers in this space are drop shippers), offering a broad selection of private label and branded SKUs (1.5MM SKUs), and focusing on collision parts (PRTS is the 2nd largest collision auto parts importer in the U.S.). 

**Asymmetric Opportunity**

*Transaction Announcement*

* The immediate upside is a definitive transaction being announced and completed. 
   * PRTS is a highly strategic asset for other industry players considering their owned supply chain (with additional capacity to support 50% incremental revenue growth), $600MM in revenue, 100MM annual website visitors, and 10MM annual customers. 
   * We understand this to be a competitive public process with multiple parties at the table, including strategics and financial sponsors.
   * Craig Hallum is the bank selling the company. Craig Hallum's research division upgraded the stock to a **buy rating with a $3 PT (currently trades at $1) the day the strategic alternatives announcement was made**.
   * Wilson Sonsini is the sell-side legal advisor who is widely respected in the field of M&A. 

*Business as Usual - No Transaction*

* While PRTS's core business is commoditized and subject to volatility in their major cost centers (parts COGS, FedEx shipping, Google CPC), management is doing the right things to improve potential earnings power at the business:
   * Bypassing Google CPC (costs 18% of revenue when orders go through paid Search) with the launch of their mobile app in August 2023. The app now does over 10% of e-commerce revenue. Their closest comp in Europe has an app that contributes 60% of revenue (launched their app 6 years ago). The app also creates customer loyalty and drives repeat purchases.
   * Bypassing FedEx LTL by focusing on B2B sales to fleets and repair shops. Working with Diligent, the last-mile delivery service, to deliver products with operations currently active in 2/5 distribution centers (methodically expanding to ensure best service for national accounts). B2B contribution margin is 3x higher than DTC.
   * De-risking from low-income consumers who are more subject to economic cyclicality by stocking luxury European parts and taking up prices.
   * Focus on high-margin, fee-based income with the launch of subscriptions and other partnerships (e.g. roadside assistance, warranty, financing) to monetize their customer base.
* PRTS market cap = $57MM, cash =$36MM, debt = $0. Current book value and our adjusted net liquidation value = $85MM and $44MM, respectively, resulting in substantial margin of safety.
   * We do expect some cash burn this year from a weaker consumer inhibiting revenue and tariffs increasing inventory purchase costs which may reduce book value and our net liquidation value.
   * We estimate the stock trades at 0.9x normalized EBITDA (2026E) and 2.3x normalized FCF excluding working capital effects (2026E).

2024-10-03 19:25:41,"$WFLD Positive Developments / Resumption of Trading and Planned Spinoff of Tradewind Markets Inc. Dear fellow Wellfield Technologies investors,

I want to update you on important news that affects our investment in Wellfield Technologies.

**Resumption of Trading**

I'm pleased to report that the TSX Venture Exchange has approved the resumption of trading effective October 1, 2024. This is a positive signal and restores liquidity for us shareholders.

**Planned Spinoff of Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Wellfield is continuing its efforts to spin off its wholly-owned subsidiary Tradewind Markets Inc. This spinoff is a key step in the strategy announced on July 16.

**What does this mean for us?**

1. Wellfield expects the spinoff to increase company value by allowing the markets to value Tradewind independently.
2. After the spinoff, Wellfield will be able to focus on its core competencies in cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance.
3. Wellfield will hold Tradewind shares worth $20 million USD, opening up various strategic options.

**Support for Tradewind**

Tradewind is set to be established as an independent entity focused on revolutionizing the gold market. An independent management team and board will be set up, to be announced in a later press release.

**My Assessment**

I see great potential in these developments for Wellfield. The resumption of trading and strategic realignment through the Tradewind spinoff could positively impact the value of our shares. I'm particularly interested in the focus on the core crypto business and the opportunities arising from owning Tradewind shares.

From a technical analysis perspective, the stock price was recently frozen due to the trading halt. With the resumption of trading and this positive news, we could see a reevaluation.

**Conclusion**

In the short term, it remains exciting to watch how the market reacts to the resumption of trading and spinoff plans. Long-term, I see Wellfield well-positioned with its focus on innovative DeFi solutions and strategic positioning through the Tradewind spinoff.

I continue to plan for a long investment horizon and will closely monitor the implementation of the spinoff and the future strategy of both companies.

Let's hope these steps help Wellfield establish itself as a leading company in the DeFi space!

Best regards,

TradeToday

**PS: Trading resumed as planned on October 1, 2024. It will be interesting to see how the stock price develops in the coming days.**

**PPS: It is always a good sign when the Chief Executive Officer continues to buy shares in his company.**

**$WFLD Positive Entwicklungen / Wiederaufnahme des Handels und geplante Abspaltung von Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Liebe Mitinvestoren von Wellfield Technologies,

ich möchte euch über wichtige Neuigkeiten informieren, die unser Investment in Wellfield Technologies betreffen.

**Wiederaufnahme des Handels**

Erfreulicherweise hat die TSX Venture Exchange die Wiederaufnahme des Handels mit Wirkung zum 1. Oktober 2024 genehmigt. Dies ist ein positives Signal und stellt die Liquidität für uns Aktionäre wieder her.

**Geplante Abspaltung von Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Wellfield setzt seine Bemühungen um die Abspaltung seiner hundertprozentigen Tochtergesellschaft Tradewind Markets Inc. fort. Diese Abspaltung ist ein wichtiger Schritt in der am 16. Juli angekündigten Strategie.

**Was bedeutet das für uns?**

1. Wellfield erwartet, dass die Abspaltung den Unternehmenswert steigern wird, indem sie es den Märkten ermöglicht, Tradewind unabhängig zu bewerten.
2. Nach der Abspaltung wird sich Wellfield auf seine Kernkompetenzen im Bereich Kryptowährungen und dezentrale Finanzen konzentrieren können.
3. Wellfield wird Tradewind-Aktien im Wert von 20 Millionen US-Dollar halten, was verschiedene strategische Optionen eröffnet.

**Unterstützung für Tradewind**

Tradewind soll als unabhängige Einheit etabliert werden, die sich auf die Revolutionierung des Goldmarktes konzentriert. Ein unabhängiges Managementteam und ein Vorstand werden eingerichtet, was in einer späteren Pressemitteilung bekannt gegeben wird.

**Meine Einschätzung**

Ich sehe in diesen Entwicklungen großes Potenzial für Wellfield. Die Wiederaufnahme des Handels und die strategische Neuausrichtung durch die Abspaltung von Tradewind könnten den Wert unserer Aktien positiv beeinflussen. Besonders interessant finde ich die Fokussierung auf das Kerngeschäft im Krypto-Bereich und die Möglichkeiten, die sich durch den Besitz der Tradewind-Aktien ergeben.

Charttechnisch war der Kurs zuletzt durch den Handelsstopp eingefroren. Mit der Wiederaufnahme des Handels und diesen positiven Nachrichten könnte es zu einer Neubewertung kommen.

**Fazit**

Kurzfristig bleibt die Entwicklung spannend zu beobachten, insbesondere wie der Markt auf die Wiederaufnahme des Handels und die Abspaltungspläne reagiert. Langfristig sehe ich Wellfield mit seinem Fokus auf innovative DeFi-Lösungen und der strategischen Positionierung durch die Tradewind-Abspaltung gut aufgestellt.

Ich plane weiterhin einen langen Anlagehorizont und werde die Umsetzung der Abspaltung sowie die zukünftige Strategie beider Unternehmen genau verfolgen.

Lasst uns hoffen, dass diese Schritte Wellfield dabei helfen, sich als führendes Unternehmen im DeFi-Bereich zu etablieren!

Viele Grüße

TradeToday

 

**PS: Der Handel wurde wie geplant am 1. Oktober 2024 wieder aufgenommen. Es wird interessant sein zu beobachten, wie sich der Kurs in den kommenden Tagen entwickelt.**

2024-09-06 15:37:54,"$WFLD Good News / Reverse Take-Over (RTO) of Tradewind Markets Inc. Dear Wellfield Technologies Investors,

I want to inform you about a significant development that could greatly impact our investment in Wellfield Technologies.

**Reverse Take-Over (RTO) of Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Wellfield Technologies has entered into a definitive agreement with Leonovus Inc., which will lead to a Reverse Take-Over (RTO). Leonovus will acquire all issued and outstanding common shares of Tradewind Markets Inc., a subsidiary of Wellfield. Upon completion of the RTO, Leonovus will be renamed “Tradewind Markets Inc.”

**What does this mean for us?**

Tradewind Markets is revolutionizing the digital gold market through the use of blockchain technology. With products like VaultChain™ Gold and VaultChain™ Silver, Tradewind has already digitized physical metal worth over 170 million CAD. The introduction of smart contract-based DeFi services, including an Automated Market-Maker (AMM) for spot gold trading, is on the horizon.

**Support from Wellfield**

Wellfield will continue to support Tradewind, especially in the first 18 months following the RTO. This collaboration aims to ensure that Tradewind can further develop its innovative platform and expand its market leadership in digital gold trading.

**Financing and Shareholder Approval**

A private placement equity financing is planned to raise a minimum of 4 million CAD and a maximum of 6 million CAD. Several transactions and changes require the approval of Leonovus shareholders, including the name change, share consolidation, and approval of the RTO.

**My Assessment**

I see enormous potential in this development for Wellfield. The innovative technology of Tradewind and the support from Wellfield could significantly increase the value of our shares. Of course, the investment remains speculative, but the long-term prospects are promising.

I have used the price drops to buy more shares and lower my average purchase price. From a technical analysis perspective, the price has been in a sideways range for almost a month. These news could lead to a breakout from the range and potentially rising prices.

**Conclusion**

In the short term, the stock price remains a test of patience. However, in the long term, I am convinced that Wellfield, with its groundbreaking DeFi solutions and the support of Tradewind, can be successful. I am planning a very long investment horizon and will closely monitor the developments.

Let’s hope together that Wellfield, with its innovative solutions, becomes one of the leading DeFi companies of the future!

Best regards,

TradeToday

**PS: A trading halt was in effect at the time of this posting!**

 (The trading halt on Wellfield Technologies was imposed by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO). Such trading halts are often implemented to ensure a fair and orderly market, especially when significant corporate news is released. In this case, the trading halt is likely - I'm almost certain - related to the announcement of the reverse take-over (RTO) by Tradewind Markets Inc. to ensure that all market participants have a chance to process the new information. It will be interesting to see what happens when this is lifted).

**$WFLD Gute Nachrichten / Reverse Take-Over (RTO) von Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Liebe Mitinvestoren von Wellfield Technologies,

ich möchte euch über eine bedeutende Entwicklung informieren, die unser Investment in Wellfield Technologies maßgeblich beeinflussen könnte.

**Reverse Take-Over (RTO) von Tradewind Markets Inc.**

Wellfield Technologies hat eine endgültige Vereinbarung mit Leonovus Inc. getroffen, die zu einem Reverse Take-Over (RTO) führen wird. Leonovus wird alle ausgegebenen und ausstehenden Stammaktien von Tradewind Markets Inc., einer Tochtergesellschaft von Wellfield, übernehmen. Nach Abschluss des RTO wird Leonovus in “Tradewind Markets Inc.” umbenannt.

**Was bedeutet das für uns?**

Tradewind Markets revolutioniert den digitalen Goldmarkt durch die Nutzung von Blockchain-Technologie. Mit Produkten wie VaultChain™ Gold und VaultChain™ Silver hat Tradewind bereits physisches Metall im Wert von über 170 Millionen CAD digitalisiert. Die Einführung von Smart-Contract-basierten DeFi-Dienstleistungen, einschließlich eines Automated Market-Makers (AMM) für den Spot-Goldhandel, steht bevor.

**Unterstützung durch Wellfield**

Wellfield wird Tradewind weiterhin unterstützen, insbesondere in den ersten 18 Monaten nach dem RTO. Diese Zusammenarbeit soll sicherstellen, dass Tradewind seine innovative Plattform weiterentwickeln und seine Marktführerschaft im digitalen Goldhandel ausbauen kann.

**Finanzierung und Aktionärszustimmung**

Es ist eine Privatplatzierungs-Eigenkapitalfinanzierung geplant, um mindestens 4 Millionen CAD und maximal 6 Millionen CAD zu beschaffen. Mehrere Transaktionen und Änderungen bedürfen der Zustimmung der Leonovus-Aktionäre, darunter die Namensänderung, die Aktienkonsolidierung und die Genehmigung der RTO.

**Meine Einschätzung**

Ich sehe in dieser Entwicklung ein enormes Potenzial für Wellfield. Die innovative Technologie von Tradewind und die Unterstützung durch Wellfield könnten den Wert unserer Aktien erheblich steigern. Natürlich bleibt das Investment spekulativ, aber die langfristigen Chancen sind vielversprechend.

Ich habe die Kursverluste genutzt, um nachzukaufen und meinen Durchschnittskaufpreis zu senken. Charttechnisch befindet sich der Kurs schon seit fast einem Monat in einer Seitwärtsrange. Diese Neuigkeiten könnten dazu führen, dass wir zeitnah wieder aus der Range nach oben ausbrechen und sodann wieder steigende Kurse sehen.

**Fazit**

Kurzfristig bleibt der Kurs eine Geduldsprobe. Doch längerfristig bin ich überzeugt, dass Wellfield mit seinen bahnbrechenden DeFi-Lösungen und der Unterstützung von Tradewind erfolgreich sein kann. Ich plane einen sehr langen Anlagehorizont ein und werde die Entwicklungen genau verfolgen.

Lasst uns gemeinsam hoffen, dass Wellfield mit innovativen Lösungen zu einem der führenden DeFi-Unternehmen der Zukunft wird!

Viele Grüße

 **PS: Zum Zeitpunkt dieses Post, wurde ein Handelsstopp verhängt!**

(Der Handelsstopp bei Wellfield Technologies wurde von der Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) verhängt. Solche Handelsstopps werden oft implementiert, um einen fairen und geordneten Markt zu gewährleisten, insbesondere wenn bedeutende Unternehmensnachrichten veröffentlicht werden. In diesem Fall hängt der Handelsstopp wahrscheinlich - ich bin mir fast sicher - mit der Ankündigung des Reverse Take-Over (RTO) von Tradewind Markets Inc. zusammen, um sicherzustellen, dass alle Marktteilnehmer die Möglichkeit haben, die neuen Informationen zu verarbeiten. Es wird spannend, was passiert, wenn dieser wieder aufgehoben wird.)

Hello Wellfield Investors and Stakeholders,

As we navigate through an exciting and transitional period of growth and innovation at Wellfield, I want to address several pertinent topics regarding our current projects, future endeavors, and highlight recent press releases that provide further context to ongoing operations at Wellfield. I would also like to take a moment to acknowledge the questions and feedback we have received from you. Your insights are crucial to our strategy and operations, and in this update, I will address the key themes that resonate most strongly with you: our share price performance, Coinmama growth, our Gold product offerings, and other future strategic plans. 

Share Price Performance

We understand that recent fluctuations in the stock have been concerning, especially when they do not seem to align with the performance of related assets like Bitcoin. We remain committed to our strategic goals and are optimistic about the future of our company. We are actively working on a few initiatives we have recently announced, including the launch of our Gold products, and enhancing Coinmama's offerings with mobile app integrating Fireblocks technology. Each of these initiatives represents a significant opportunity for our company to grow and deliver value to our shareholders.

We acknowledge that building market awareness and attracting new investors is an area where we can improve. To this end, we are focused on leveraging our most innovative solutions, such Gold trading platform for institutional clients, and wGLD- gold for retail clients on Ethereum blockchain with Optimism products, for new awareness efforts which we believe will capture
attention and differentiate WFLD in the marketplace in 2024.

While we cannot predict future stock price movements, we are confident in our business model, our team, and our strategy. We believe that by executing on our plans and continuing to innovate, we can create long-term value for all our stakeholders. Our management team is not only attentive but also personally invested in the prosperity of our share value. We are implementing robust strategies aimed at improving our financial health and market position, thereby enhancing shareholder value. Coinmama Growth Growing our user base on Coinmama and deepening engagement continue to be a cornerstone of our success. Our focus remains on enhancing user experience and increasing our service offerings to attract and retain users. Shifting the focus to Mobile
Coinmama stands as one of the world's most enduring and trusted brands, offering customers a seamless way to transition their funds onto the blockchain while retaining complete control over their cryptocurrency. As more and more of Coinmama's clients opt for mobile access, Wellfield has taken steps to future-proof the Coinmama mobile app through its partnership with Fireblocks. This collaboration integrates Fireblocks' non-custodial wallet-as-a-service solutions
into the core of the Coinmama wallet. With this enhancement, customers can maintain full control over the cryptocurrency they purchase from Coinmama, enjoying simple and secure access to the best of Web3 and DeFi, all from a single platform. Other benefits of the new Coinmama mobile app will be disclosed and available when we launch towards mid-year.
Wellfield’s Gold Product Offerings
The recent launch of wGLD is an exciting development that we believe will significantly enhance our product offerings. This initiative will allow our users to invest in gold with the added benefit of earning yield, merging traditional asset security with innovative financial technology. That said, we remain committed to servicing two distinct blockchain-based gold ecosystems, each catering to specific investor communities: 

VaultChain Gold and wGLD.

• VaultChain Gold: 

Developed on the Tradewind Ledger, VaultChain Gold offers a closed precious metals trading platform tailored exclusively to Custodial Participants of the Royal Canadian Mint and their clients. This initiative revolutionizes the institutional gold marketplace, providing unparalleled accessibility, security, and efficiency in precious metals trading.

• wGLD: 

Serving as the cornerstone of a global and open gold ecosystem for the DeFi
community on Ethereum, wGLD embodies Wellfield's commitment to democratizing
access to physical gold. With its launch on Optimism, a prominent Ethereum Layer 2
blockchain, wGLD opens new horizons for DeFi enthusiasts, enabling seamless
integration into decentralized trading, lending, borrowing, and yield-generation
opportunities. For more information about wGLD, visit https://www.wellfield.gold.

Strategic Path Forward

Our roadmap is designed to foster sustainable growth and enhance shareholder value. Key focuses include scaling our core business operations, advancing our DeFi strategy and patent applications, diversifying our revenue streams, and continuing to innovate within the crypto and financial technology sectors. We are also prioritizing the integration of recent partnerships and
acquisitions to streamline operations and leverage synergies within the space as well as enhancing shareholder value.
In closing, I want you to know that your feedback drives our decisions and long-term planning. As we move forward, your continued support and feedback remain invaluable to us. We are committed to transparency and are excited to share these updates with you as they develop.
Thank you for your ongoing support and belief in our vision.

Hallo Wellfield-Investoren und -Stakeholder,

wir befinden uns in einer aufregenden Übergangsphase des Wachstums und der Innovation bei Wellfield. Ich möchte einige relevante Themen ansprechen, die unsere aktuellen Projekte und zukünftigen Bestrebungen betreffen, und die jüngsten Pressemitteilungen hervorheben, die
weitere Informationen zu den laufenden Aktivitäten bei Wellfield liefern. Ich möchte mich auch für die Fragen und Rückmeldungen bedanken, die wir von Ihnen erhalten haben. Ihre Erkenntnisse sind für unsere Strategie und unsere Geschäftstätigkeit von entscheidender
Bedeutung, und in diesem Update werde ich auf die Kernthemen eingehen, die Ihnen am
meisten am Herzen liegen: unsere Aktienkursentwicklung, das Wachstum von Coinmama, unser Goldprodukt-Angebot und andere zukünftige strategische Pläne.

Aktienkursentwicklung

Wir verstehen, dass die jüngsten Schwankungen der Aktie besorgniserregend waren, vor allem, wenn sie nicht mit der Performance von verwandten Vermögenswerten wie Bitcoin übereinstimmen. Wir halten an unseren strategischen Zielen fest und sind optimistisch, was die Zukunft unseres Unternehmens angeht. Wir arbeiten aktiv an einigen Initiativen, die wir kürzlich angekündigt haben, darunter die Einführung unserer Goldprodukte und die Erweiterung des Angebots von Coinmama durch eine mobile App, die die Fireblocks-Technologie integriert. Jede dieser Initiativen stellt eine bedeutende Chance für unser Unternehmen dar, zu wachsen und unseren Aktionären einen Mehrwert zu bieten.
Wir sind uns bewusst, dass die Steigerung des Marktbewusstseins und die Gewinnung neuer Anleger ein Bereich ist, in dem wir uns verbessern können. Zu diesem Zweck konzentrieren wir uns darauf, unsere innovativsten Lösungen, wie die Goldhandelsplattform für institutionelle
Kunden und wGLD-Gold für Privatkunden auf der Ethereum-Blockchain mit Optimismus-
Produkten, für neue Sensibilisierungsmaßnahmen zu nutzen, von denen wir glauben, dass sie die Aufmerksamkeit auf sich ziehen und WFLD im Jahr 2024 auf dem Markt differenzieren
werden.

Auch wenn wir die zukünftige Entwicklung des Aktienkurses nicht vorhersagen können, sind wir von unserem Geschäftsmodell, unserem Team und unserer Strategie überzeugt. Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass wir durch die Umsetzung unserer Pläne und durch kontinuierliche Innovation langfristige Werte für alle unsere Interessengruppen schaffen können. Unser Managementteam ist nicht nur aufmerksam, sondern auch persönlich in das Wachstum unseres Aktienwerts investiert.
Wir verfolgen die Umsetzung solider Strategien zur Verbesserung unserer finanziellen Stabilität und Marktposition und damit zur Steigerung des Unternehmenswertes.

Coinmama Wachstum
Die Vergrößerung unserer Nutzerbasis auf Coinmama und die Verstärkung des Engagements sind weiterhin ein Eckpfeiler unseres Erfolgs. Unser Fokus liegt weiterhin auf der Verbesserung der Nutzererfahrung und der Erweiterung unseres Serviceangebots, um Nutzer anzuziehen und
zu binden. Verlagerung des Schwerpunkts auf Mobile Coinmama ist eine der beständigsten und vertrauenswürdigsten Marken der Welt und bietet
Kunden eine nahtlose Möglichkeit, ihre Gelder auf die Blockchain zu übertragen und dabei die vollständige Kontrolle über ihre Kryptowährung zu behalten. Da sich immer mehr Kunden von Coinmama für einen mobilen Zugang interessieren, hat Wellfield Schritte unternommen, um die mobile App von Coinmama durch seine Partnerschaft mit Fireblocks zukunftssicher zu machen.
Diese Zusammenarbeit integriert die nicht-pfändbaren Wallet-as-a-Service-Lösungen von Fireblocks in den Kern der Coinmama-Wallet. Mit dieser Erweiterung können Kunden die volle Kontrolle über die Kryptowährung behalten, die sie bei Coinmama kaufen und genießen einen
einfachen und sicheren Zugriff auf das Beste von Web3 und DeFi, alles von einer einzigen
Plattform aus. Weitere Vorteile der neuen Coinmama Mobile App werden bekannt gegeben und verfügbar sein, wenn wir gegen Mitte des Jahres starten.

Wellfields Gold-Produktangebote

Die kürzliche Einführung von wGLD ist eine aufregende Entwicklung, von der wir glauben, dass sie unser Produktangebot erheblich erweitern wird. Diese Initiative wird es unseren Nutzern ermöglichen, in Gold zu investieren und gleichzeitig eine Rendite zu erwirtschaften, indem sie die Sicherheit traditioneller Vermögenswerte mit innovativer Finanztechnologie verbindet.
Nichtsdestotrotz werden wir auch weiterhin zwei verschiedene Blockchain-basierte Gold-Ökosysteme anbieten, die sich jeweils an bestimmte Anlegergruppen richten: 

VaultChain Gold und wGLD.

• VaultChain Gold: 

VaultChain Gold wurde auf der Grundlage des Tradewind Ledger entwickelt und bietet eine geschlossene Edelmetallhandelsplattform, die ausschließlich auf die Custodial Participants der Royal Canadian Mint und deren Kunden
zugeschnitten ist. Diese Initiative revolutioniert den institutionellen Goldmarkt und bietet eine beispiellose Zugänglichkeit, Sicherheit und Effizienz im Edelmetallhandel.

• wGLD: 

Als Eckpfeiler eines globalen und offenen Gold-Ökosystems für die DeFi-Community auf Ethereum verkörpert wGLD Wellfields Engagement für die Schaffung eines digitalen Zugangs zu physischem Gold.

2024-04-29 11:30:27,"DeFi Disruptor Wellfield Tech Going Layer 2 - Loading Up For Moon Mission? Fellow Ape Degenerates,

Your degen options trader TradeToday here with a juicy update on Wellfield Technologies Inc. ($WFLD) that you won't want to miss. Full disclosure, I posted a similar thesis on another investing platform last few weeks ago.

First off, let's address the elephant in the room - Wellfield has been an absolute beatdown lately, plunging to 6 cents CAD. As a grizzled vet in these Pampas, I know all too well the risks of penny stock investing. But I also know bigger risks mean bigger potential rewards for us degen apes willing to go full send.

Despite the carnage, I'm still fully convinced of Wellfield's massive potential in the DeFi space. Their visionary plans, stacked patent filings, and partnerships with players like Banxa and Fireblocks point to some serious moonshot opportunities.

The real game-changer here is Wellfield's latest move to the Optimism Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. This bad boy uses cutting-edge rollup tech to bundle tons of transactions on L2, then settle them on the Ethereum mainnet for peanuts in gas fees.

**But here's the kicker** - Optimism is fully compatible and secure with Ethereum, so Wellfield can build out their whole decentralized fintech ecosystem on it with insane scalability. We're talking decentralized trading for crypto, stocks, ETFs and more all powered by these low gas L2 vibes.

Where I see the real tendies is in their planned rollout of these products onto the Coinmama platform with its huge existing user base. Suddenly Wellfield can start juicing revenue and profits from all that user activity and volume with monetization from:

* Transaction fees
* Building a decentralized order book
* And more

The Situation:

* Averaged down, currently at $0.24 CAD cost basis
* $0.05 CAD bottom could mark turnaround if buying overtakes selling
* Watching for triangle breakout, under 5 cents would be warning sign

Gotta give props to Wellfield's execution so far:

✅ Website revamp

✅ User marketing

✅ Coinmama trading platform live

Combine that with these new scalable products and we could see a major rev/profit ramp. Those $5M CAD raises are key growth investments.

What really gives me conviction though is management's consistent delivery on their announcements. The gold-backed wGLD token hit mainnet in Q1 as forecast, the Coinmama and Tradewind acquisitions closed on schedule, and the global Coinmama app rollout to 180+ countries is coming this summer.

**TLDR:** Make no mistake, this is a white-knuckle, high-risk play in the near-term. But long-term, I'm betting big that Wellfield can leverage Optimism's scalability and their multi-product suite to emerge as a disruptive DeFi heavyweight - IF they nail the rollout. As an investor who's felt the burn before, I'm strapped in for an extended trip to alpha centauri on this one.

Will be watching their progress and milestones like a hawk while constantly reevaluating my position. Can't rule out a total loss either. But let's hope Wellfield takes the DeFi universe by storm with these game-changing solutions!

2021-09-26 23:22:28,"LexaGene $LXG.V ($LXXGF)- An interesting play in the diagnostics space. LexaGene’s MiQlab is an automated PCR device that can test for 27 targets at the same time and provide results within 2 hours.

Automated means no more need for highly skilled employees to perform these tests, reducing time, money and chance of errors.

PCR is the gold standard.  It provides accurate results and can provide quantitative information.

The ability to simultaneously test 27 targets means we’re not just ruling out a diagnosis, but we can end up with a very good probability of ruling in a diagnosis and having a much better idea which treatments should be used.

Results in 2 hours means we no longer have to wait for labs to provide the results which can take from 24 hours to 28 days depending on what is being tested.  Regardless of what the target is, the MiQLab completes it in within 2 hours.

There are other PCR devices out there, so what is special about the MiQLab? 

OPEN ACCESS is the feature an investor really needs to understand.

This makes the MiQLab the first of its kind with no direct comparator.

Open access allows customers with different patient populations to customize by looking for the 27 targets they are more likely to see in their practice.  This greatly increases the chance of an accurate diagnosis rather than just ruling out certain things.  No more guessing!

LexaGene also focuses on antimicrobial resistance (AMR).  The MiQLab can predict if a certain pathogen will be resistant to certain antibiotics.

Many scientists believe AMR could be the cause of the next pandemic.

CEO Jack Regan is the inventor of the MiQLab and founder of LexaGene.  He owns a big chunk of shares and is fully committed to making this work.  This isn’t his first rodeo with this type of device.

COO Steve Armstrong has been responsible for obtaining FDA and global regulatory approvals in over 100 countries for more than 50 devices with hundreds of indications, implementing best-in-class quality management systems, and ensuring worldwide compliance.

Many industries require timely, accurate pathogen testing before they can serve their customers, and LexaGene will be targeting all of these.

Vet, Food, Human, Biologic + Cannabis + Vaccine producers , Research, Agriculture, Cosmetics, Water safety, US Army etc...

LexaGene is debt free and has enough cash for several months while they concentrate on marketing, FDA submission and increasing sales.

The MiQLab is very affordable compared to other devices on the market.

Their razor blade model uses simple disposable cartridges, not expensive custom embedded cartridges like the competition.

LexaGene is actively preparing for FDA submission and uplisting to Nasdaq, so that they will have things in place when the time is right.

What are the main challenges?

1.  Share price is down since the company became public.
2.  The company is growing and they might need to raise more money next year.
3.  FDA approval is never guaranteed.
4.  Adoption by clinics and hospitals could end up being challenging.

Despite these challenges I still think LexaGene is a risk worth taking.  Worse case, I don’t think they go to zero and they get bought out.  Best case, they become one of the leaders and the stock goes up 100X in the next 5 to 10 years.",,reddit/MicrocapStocks

2021-08-28 00:50:58,"This small holding company is up almost 10% in the past week! Here's why This company is MBHCF - a holding company which began in 2016 that is actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses.

MBH has announced on 19 August 2021 that it agreed to the terms for the acquisition of Vista Care Solutions Limited (Vista Care) as the latest step in its extensive acquisition drive. The completion of this acquisition is subject to regulatory approval for the proposed change of ownership from UK city councils. Upon receiving approval, Vista Care will become part of MBH's health vertical, joining Samuel Hobson House.

MBH added four new industry verticals alone in 2020 as part of a concerted acquisition drive which is continuing in 2021 with Vista care becoming the 26th company in the Group portfolio.

This has likely proven to be a catalyst, driving the share price up by almost 10% in the past week.

Analysts have price targets at up to $10 for this stock, which currently trades at about $0.30 a share. Personally, I’d seriously weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. There are some bullish signs in the company’s financials, yet there are also certain metrics that raise eyebrows, like the dilution of shares and low volume. It’s hard to say whether the company will be back in full swing after the end of the pandemic. Hopefully we’ll see MBH rise to its full potential!",,reddit/MicrocapStocks

2021-08-05 14:34:59,"Small acquisition companies: Possible 3000% upside?   

Berkshire Hathaway has dominated the market for holding companies for a long time. However, over the years, smaller and more exciting holding companies have emerged with refreshing new approaches. These small holding companies could seriously become something huge in the future. One play I'm looking at is MBHCF, a holding company which began in 2018 that is actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. 

**PROS:**

***Strong financials***

The company has a strong and competitive P/e ratio of 8 (TTM), revenue growth of 19% (from 2019A to 2020A) and gross margin of 20.9% (from 2019A to 2020A). P/b ratio is also healthy at about 0.3. They have produced surprisingly promising numbers despite the hit taken from Covid-19. 

***Dividends***

The company ended the year in profit despite being heavily disrupted by the Covid-19 virus. The dividend is paid out at $0.0059 per share, which is about 2% of the current share price.

***Diversification***

The company has completed a total of 26 acquisitions so far, with 12 acquisitions in 2020 alone. The rate at which MBH is acquiring companies is impressive, and the acquired companies have very high profitability.

***Small market cap***

With a market cap of just over 20M USD, there is huge growth potential for this company as it continues with its expansion model. Small cap stocks have historically produced greater annual returns than mid-cap and large-cap stocks due to greater growth potential and better returns in the long term.

***Bullish estimates***

Analysts suggest that it could have a price target of $10 based on its financials and projected estimates, resulting in an upside of over 3000%.

Here’s a link to the analyst report:

[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/MBHCF/news/BUY-RATING-FOR-MBH-CORPORATION-PLC-AT-10-PRICE-TARGET?id=302215](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/MBHCF/news/BUY-RATING-FOR-MBH-CORPORATION-PLC-AT-10-PRICE-TARGET?id=302215)

However, there are still things to consider when looking into such a stock. Here are some things to consider.

**RISKS:**

***Dilution of shares***

The total number of shares outstanding amounted to 70.5M at the end of 2020, up from 39.2M at the end of 2019. Dilution of shares is always a concern as it lowers the EPS. However, it is important to note that the extra shares were issued as payment to acquire companies, so this could very well be a strategic move if these acquisitions generate sufficient profit for MBH. Future profits could also be used to buy back shares to improve EPS.

***Uncertainty about post-Covid situation***

We all know how disruptive the Covid-19 situation is, especially to small businesses. It’s not certain if all companies are able to bounce back and operate at their full potential. As such, being an acquisition company, MBH is open to the risk of underperforming if their acquired companies face difficulty in recovering from the situation.

In conclusion, micro-caps are often risky. Whether you enter a position in this stock or not depends on how much you believe in the expansion model and future profitability of MBH. Personally, I believe it's a risk worth taking because of its prospects and financials. Going long term on this seems to be a decent play. What do y’all think?",,reddit/MicrocapStocks

LITTLE FALLS, N.J., June 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- [Ceragon Networks Ltd.](https://www.ceragon.com/)   (NASDAQ: CRNT), the global innovator and leading solutions provider of   5G wireless transport, has announced new orders and renewed  partnerships  with large North American service providers. These orders  focus on  expanding 5G network reach in dense areas, as well as keeping  rural  areas connected, up to speed, and able to compete with the rest  of the  world on a level footing. These material orders, among others,  have  resulted in strong Q2 bookings in North America.

One   of the companies who selected Ceragon is a large Tier 1 North American   carrier who field-tested multiple solutions. As Ceragon performed  better  than competitors, the operator successfully deployed, validated,  and  accepted Ceragon's Multiband Solution delivering a staggering 10  Gbps  over 4 miles. Thanks to this solution, mobile subscribers will see   higher download speeds and the operator will enjoy increased customer   satisfaction and reduced churn.""",,reddit/MicrocapStocks

**Search for POC (proof of concept)  ... In my opinion ... N.A is DISH and Pacific Rim is Rakuten ...** 

"" We are very busy with 5G network design  wins and POC's processes, as well as with activities around the release  of our new 5G products. We are participating in various stages of the  5G selection process for operators throughout the world ***each with the  potential to lead to very large multiyear sales***. This, our long-term  efforts that began with design wins, progress toward POCs or proof of  concept with small initial shipments, and finally, as we believe we'll  see volume shipments and deployment. On the POC front, we are preparing  for a POC with an emerging greenfield service provider in **North America.**

It  will test a wide coverage, 5G solution with gigabit backhaul to support  its up and coming 5G rollout. *We are also preparing for a field trial  with one of the Pacific Rim l*eading open network operators following a  very successful lab trial. Our solution will provide them with 20  gigabits 5G mid-haul capacity in millimeter-wave spectrum. We have also  seen an increased number of design wins, including multiple recent  awards from service providers in Europe and North America preparing to  transition to 5G.""

In    a nutshell, the 5G rollout began 1 year ago… 1st  phase of rollout is    to the large population centers where access to  fiber and massive    amounts of customer cash is all around. OVERLOOKED is  the SECOUND phase    of the rollout;  which is connecting the REST OF THE URBAN AND RURAL    area (where fiber  is unavailable, too expensive to be laid) between  the   population centers  with wireless nodes….. necessitating the    replacement/upgrade of tens of  millions of cellular radios/receivers,    nodes,  etc.  MASSIVE equipment upgrades are needed to support 5G    wireless mid  and back hauling. The small cap firms that support this    phase of the  rollout have been simply over looked, especially the ones    that provide  “Best of Breed” components that are swiftly becoming  a    necessity for 5g. The second phase of the rollout will go on for     YEARS. 

In the past the telecom    large caps  like Nokia, Ericson and Huawei bundled front/mid/back haul    equipment in  with other services and components to create bundled    packages to sell to  the Tier 1 carriers, shutting out the smaller    companies.   Not this time.  5G requires OpenRAN , Best of Breed parts    for the  networks to minimize latency while exponentially increasing    speed and  bandwidth.  Tier 1 Carriers are going Best of Breed for    component’s  using an OpenRAN standard.  This removes the threat  of    bundled deals from a large section of the equation. This will  directly    benefit the small/micro caps w the best of breed components.  CRNT is    one of these small caps… my opinion is that it will move; and  move  big.

Ceragon   (CRNT) basically  split the Best of Breed market with Huawei..  which  is  now mostly  banned from participating in most western &  Indian   networks …  this removes CRNT’s main competition for best of breed    wireless  front/mid/back haul radios in most markets.   Connecting the   rural  areas for 5g is just starting.. CRNT has 12+  announced 5G design   wins  all over the world.  There is speculation that  they landed a  large   DISH contract for a greenfield (new) 5g network in  North  America.    (see Cowen Investment Call [https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen90/crnt/1966227](https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen90/crnt/1966227)at  5:15ish . )  Also, from Cowen conf call .... Dish did NOT invite    Ericson nor Nokia to participate in the contract bidding as they were     only getting bids from best of breed components. CRNT is also releasing     a next generation 5G chipset capable of 100Gb wireless…tapeout  slated    for JULY 2021….  The author, and CRNT management (as stated in  conf    calls) knows of no other advanced 5G wireless  chipset in  development   that comes close to these speeds. This should be  a MAJOR  additional   advantage.

Trading w a  market cap   of about $307 Million .. a massively discounted  1.1 times  anticipated   2021 sales, conservative management, 12+ 5G wins, A  NEW  100Gb wireless   chipset taping out within 60 days (stated in July on   last conf  call),   the very real potential  to double or triple rev  from this  chipset, as  well as the potential to  OEM it to current  competitors, or  spin the  chip division off as a new  company, or just  get completely  bought out.  CRNT, with Neptune (their  100Gb wireless  5G chipset) has  vast potential   that wallstreet has completely  overlooked.

All   research has  been gleaned from  public information, web research,   intuition and  conference calls. Not  investment advice, simply pointing   out a  company that I believe is a  diamond in the rough; as such the   author  is LONG on CRNT and has  been accumulating for over a year.

CO2 Gro dissolves CO2 into the water which is then applied to plants to increase their growth and yield while protecting against pathogens. The company has numerous trials underway with some very significant growers. The goal for CO2 Gro is to reach cash-flow positive in 2021. I believe this is definitely in reach as a major grower completes their trial at the end of June 2021.

This grower, Hidroexpo, has already stated that they achieved a 20% increase in bell pepper yield and is happy with the trial results.

Hidroexpo is just one of many trials underway including numerous trials (and some small sales) to cannabis growers who can recoup their investment in as little as 1 grow.

Having investigated at my leisure, I concluded that the company is sold at a significant discount. As you know the ‘market trades future events as the current ones are already priced in. So, Europe and the UK are already coming out of the crisis, the proportion of the vaccinated population is rising, and with it, businesses are opening, and economic activity is increasing.  


The analysts covering this company, most likely a commissioned study, suggest a target price of $10. Let's face it, anything can happen but on what planning horizon. | don't really trust sell-side analysts, so I form my own estimate, luckily with experience.  


On my part, I assume that the company should return to March 2020 values, i.e. $1, within a year and a half. In my view, this is the most conservative forecast expected for this stock, as the company has done about 15 mergers over 3 period of more than a year, expanding its portfolio. Retail and construction are also recovering, which is 70% of the holding’s revenues. On top of that, the company has not realized any negative effects of quarantine at the management level, etc. Bond payments are on track and the holding structure is only growing, with no disposal of subsidiaries.

Also after creating this post I realized that I have not the karma to post on r/pennystocks so I will post it here instead.

**Disclosure:** I have been holding KABN systems North America for almost 1 month now. For disclosure I got in at and average of 25.6 cents the stock price climbed to 37 cents and currently sits at 22 cents CAD. I do not personally worry about the stock price as I prefer the underlying fundamentals (Not selling until in the multiple dollars where I think it should be valued)

**Why I have invested in KABN:**

1. KABN **products** include the biometric/blockchain secured self sovereign identity, which allows for each user to control where their data is shared, when and how. A digital avatar platform that allows for simple linking to each application. A Visa approved Credit card, with a rewards program.
2. KABN **partners** include Loop Insights and involve many other companies from health care, school campuses, travel, and banking. They have also partnered recently with an AR company to improve their Liquid Avatar.
3. KABN **team** has many years of experience in each of their fields, from payment systems, online security, cryptography, and user interface.
4. KABN's **potential** value that is offered to both users and institutions with this technology is tremendous. KABN offers a security platform that other apps can interact with. Each digital identity will be tailored BY THE USER who chooses what information to give to each program (Facebook, banking, work, travel, healthcare).
5. KABN's **pipeline** is not only based on the work KABN is doing, but also in those companies which have partnered with them. As KABN offers the operating system in which these other institutions will interact on top of. Their Liquid Avatar is set to go live on February 18th
6. KABN's **finances** are incredible. Recently in December they made out to raise 1 million dollars and instead received 4 million dollars in both brokered and non-brokered financing.
7. **Who Financed KABN?** Non other than Robert Anson...Ceo of Loop Insights. Now this is the closest thing to insider trading I can possibly think of. This point here is in my mind crazy and I do not know why more people are not talking about them.
8. **22.5 million dollar market cap.....** 10x or 20x would not surprise me 

**Short up to date Explanation (10min)**: ""[s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pazfqVa6MUo)imple You tube search of KABN will pop one up""

**Other posts** KABN has had 0 opinion pieces posted about it in the last year. Not a single soul seems to know about KABN unless you are on the KABN Forums or follow the WallStreetReporter or Algoracom on you tube.

**Possible downsides:** The CEO David Lucatch has been working for many years in the online space and in doing so he has been the CEO of a few companies (Intertainment Media) that have failed. Not every company succeeds ever with the best leadership so I do not think this is a serious worry.

**History:** The company was created after the Facebook scandal with Cambridge Analytica for those who remember or have seen the movie **The Great Hack.** KABN did have a restructuring and rebuilding last year, doing a reverse takeover of Torino Power Solutions. **Ben Kessler** was the original **CEO of KABN** and after trying to get it off the ground they brought **David Lucatch** on board to steer the ship and **rebuild KABN products and partners**. Ben is still a company director at KABN.

KABN may have came to market to soon last year, and possibly with an unrefined user face. Now that general understanding of user data is growing and KABN has created the liquid avatar I think that the time is now for KABN to succeed.

2017-03-10 17:49:47,"Kootenay Zinc gets DTC eligibility Mr. David Schmidt reports

KOOTENAY ZINC CORP. ANNOUNCES DTC ELIGIBILITY OF ITS OTCQB-LISTED COMMON SHARES & FRANKFURT LISTING

Kootenay Zinc Corp.'s common shares trade on the OTCQB, a U.S. interdealer quotation system, under the symbol KTNNF. The Company's common shares will also continue to trade on the Canadian Securities Exchange under its trading symbol ""ZNK"". In connection with the OTCQB listing, the Company obtained DTC eligibility with the Depository Trust Company for its common shares on the OTCQB. The Depository Trust Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. and manages the electronic clearing and settlement of publicly traded companies. Securities that are eligible to be electronically cleared and settled through the DTC are considered DTC eligible. This electronic method of clearing securities speeds up the receipt of shares and cash, and thus generally accelerates the settlement process for investors.

Achieving DTC eligibility to simplify trading of the Company's common shares on the OTCQB market makes it accessible to an even broader range of investors and is expected to assist with the Company's goal of increasing the liquidity and convenience of trading its common shares within the U.S.

In addition, the Company announces that its common shares trade on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol ""KYH"" which should help increase the Company's shareholder base and provide increased access to the European capital markets.

About the Company

Kootenay Zinc Corp. is a mineral exploration and development company based in Vancouver, British Columbia that is presently targeting the Sully Property. The Company is focused on discovering large-scale sedimentary-exhalative (""SEDEX"") deposits.

The Sully Property comprises 1,375 hectares located approximately 30 kilometres east of Kimberley, B.C., and overlies rocks of similar age and origin as those which host the world-class Sullivan deposit, owned by Teck Resources Ltd. Sullivan was discovered in 1892, and is known to be one of the largest SEDEX deposits in the world. Over its 100-year lifetime, Sullivan produced approximately 150 million tonnes of ore, including approximately three hundred million ounces of silver, eight million tonnes of zinc and eight million tonnes of lead. The equivalent level of strata as at Sullivan and that formed on the margin of that same basin are present at the Sully Property. The Company cautions that past results or discoveries on proximate land are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved on the Sully Property.

The scientific and technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by the Company's Project Manager, Paul Ransom, P.Geo., a ""Qualified Person"" as defined in National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.",,reddit/MicrocapStocks

As disclosed in the Company's January 10, 2017 news release, pursuant to an option agreement dated October 14, 2016 (the ""Option Agreement""), Crosby holds an option to acquire a 100% interest (subject to certain royalties) in the Goldenville Property.

Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Crosby (the ""Crosby Shares"") in consideration for the issuance of common shares of the Company on the basis of common share for each Crosby Share, resulting in the issuance of an aggregate of 5,840,000 common shares of the Company to Crosby's shareholders. Upon completion of the Acquisition, Crosby will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. For additional details regarding the Goldenville Property, the Option Agreement and the Acquisition, please refer to the Company's January 10, 2017 news release.

Completion of the Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions including, completion by the Company of an equity financing for minimum aggregate proceeds of $500,000, execution of final transaction documentation and receipt of TSX Venture Exchange approval.
