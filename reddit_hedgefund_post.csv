2025-03-29 02:28:48,Getting A Job As An Analyst at MM - Experienced Equity Research,Hot-You-7366,4,"So, I have about 8 years of equity research experience in TMT and Utilities (mostly TMT). I enjoyed the work life balance, I had a very interesting former McKInsey MD that allowed me to make big non consensus calls based on deep analytical dives including the debt side - like Viacom headed to bankruptcy and breaking covenants if it didnt merge with CBS over a few notes that saw that stock go down from 92 when I first published to 20, Other ones that got plenty of press. I also worked in media on the international finance side early in career and later on as a Product Manager for launching a streaming service at an incumbent big media. And, I did a year in early on in GDP/ADR arbitrage and equity structured products in S&T.

I passed on a couple opportunities to go the pod route because friends who worked there said the PM was burning through analysts on both. Long time ago in HF world. And frankly I was risk averse for family reasons (no children). For some reason or another I have been dying to get into a fund for about a year now. I want the long hours, I want the stress, I want to dive deep,, find consensus views i disagree with. 

All but one of the pod guys I know got blown out for good after the 3-4 pod shop every two years dance. I know more - as in ive crossed paths with them in equity research but never got chummy.

2025-03-28 12:27:18,Asset management on Wall Street,None,3,"Hi there, I’d like to hear some opinions from people in the industry on asset management on Wall Street. I’m 18, but I do hope to move to New York one day to start my own asset management firm after I graduate from university. 

When I say asset management, I mean a combination of both passive and active investing, similar to BlackRock and other famous asset managers.

I’m very fascinated by both value and growth investing in US and international equities, and have been reading many books on the subject. I’m also interested in how AI models and data-driven strategies can be applied here, especially since most of the quant strategies are mostly for short term speculative strategies and don’t provide deep insights into the long term value a company has. I hope to take a major in Data Science with a focus on Finance in university.

I’d like to find out the brutal realities of this industry. If one wanted to start an asset management firm focused on data driven value and growth investing, is prior experience working at other Wall Street firms necessary to get investors, or is a retail investing track record spanning say 10 years good enough?

If one wanted to get investors for such a firm, how hard is it usually? I want to know the cold hard truth. In Silicon Valley, you usually see Venture capital putting capital in almost any crazy idea, and you see many college kids getting millions in funding as soon as they graduate (this is obviously a major generalisation, but capital is much more actively allocated in Silicon Valley). I want to know if it’s the same on Wall Street.

If I wanted to get backing for an asset management firm, how do I convince investors, and how would I gain connections if I don’t plan on working long on Wall Street (if at all). Is a retail investment track record combined with proprietary software made specially for better insights into capital allocation a good enough sales pitch for the people on Wall Street to be convinced? 

EDIT: Thanks for all the insightful replies. Are there also ways to generate revenue for my fund to invest and manage, if I can’t get external capital? (Selling insurance contracts or providing some service etc.). Also, is there a minimum amount of AUM needed to set up a fund?",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1jltvml/asset_management_on_wall_street/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1jltvml/asset_management_on_wall_street/

2025-03-20 14:41:59,Looking to Connect with a  Hedge Fund Manager for Advice on New Quantitative Forecast Model for Short-Term Intra-Day Trades,TheRealAstrology,4,"I have spent the past 7 years exploring the philosophical limitations of time series forecasting. The limited forecast horizon of time series forecasting is the consequence of the limited ways that human beings perceive time. Broadly, I have developed a new paradigm of time series forecasting that views seasonality as a quality of time, not of data, so it’s present in every set of time series data. Seasons in this paradigm are not limited to divisions of the calendar or the clock, and the application of irregular seasonal models makes it possible to identify patterns in historical data that are otherwise undetectable. 

I have no experience in the financial sector, but I believe that what I have developed can be described as a quantitative approach that identifies opportunity periods for short-term, intra-day trades. 

This approach considers the relative difference between the close price of a stock between two consecutive seasons. It addresses the direction of the change (up or down), not the magnitude of the change. Most seasons last a single day (and the seasonal models used for this approach consist of well over 1,000 individual seasons). The direction of the change is forecast for each season (up or down) and then **the odds of that forecast being correct** are presented based on the historic “hits” of the forecasts for that season. This approach can identify days with a greater than 70% chance of correctly forecasting the movement of the stock (close to close), with a  p value of less than 0.1 (less than 10% chance that the odds are random). 

Not every season is significant, and not every season occurs every year, so the number of opportunity periods for a given stock and a given quarter varies. 

This is an entirely quantitative approach and it can be applied to any set of time series data.

This image is an example of the Q3 2025 opportunity periods for IBM. 

[https://temporalinertia.com/images/IBM\_Q3\_2025.jpg](https://temporalinertia.com/images/IBM_Q3_2025.jpg)

It does NOT include the actual forecasts for each season — it’s simply the odds that the forecast for the season, up or down, will be correct or not. It also includes some historic context of the magnitude of the change related to the season — the minimum change, the maximum change, and the mean change. 

I believe this information could be of immense value to the right kind of investment manager. It can be used only for short-term trades, and I understand this is a small and specific strategy, and that even when funds do employ day trading, it constitutes a limited percentage of their overall approach.

Nevertheless, this data is not available with any existing tool. 

I have detailed, extensive research that illustrates the methodology, and I believe the statistical and mathematical principles of this approach are sound, because they’re simple and obvious. It’s the seasonal models that make this revolutionary. 

This stock forecast strategy is a small part of a much larger body of research. I have videos posted at [https://TemporalInertia.com](https://temporalinertia.com/) that provide more information about The Model of Temporal Inertia and the new approach to seasonality. 

I’m looking to connect with a hedge fund manager who incorporates short-term, day-trading strategies to help me understand if and how this strategy might be used. 

Please DM me if you would like to review the research related to the stock forecasts/opportunity periods. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1jfqh29/looking_to_connect_with_a_hedge_fund_manager_for/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1jfqh29/looking_to_connect_with_a_hedge_fund_manager_for/

1) AI valuation collapse NOT copying 90s Tech Bubble path. Valuations need to come down and everyone is calling for it to look like 2001. But, then it wont if we are all expecting it. Tail risks of on the wrong side of a disruption play, civil unrest, the benefits accruing financially to less people - AI can reduce headcount, reduce employee compensation fundamentally, but will the savings be passed on to the consumer/debtor/home buyer? Internet killed a lot of brick and morter but AI seems like it could take away the desire to pay for a masters, PHD, some experts, on top of obvious back office/middle office and some front office.

2) Boom of Alternative Assets - I guess just due to the immense boom time of private credit and now asset backed finance, one would assume the increasing competition plus finite low hanging fruit debtors versus the AUM piling into these funds will eventually lead to risky lending practices with diversification as the defense akin to the housing lending bubble? Thoughts also on, all this excess capital in the markets is on the back of a decade and a half of QE4ever. There has to be some facing the music moment from that time that is equal and opposite right? 

3) Macro - stagflation, again on the QE4ever and tightening having not really paid the price for that yet, US debt becomes a global political tool for attack.

2025-03-07 02:18:13,Question on interpreting leveraged,ClassyPants17,1,"Please help. I feel like I get so confused when dealing with leverage. My boss asked if I could figure out our exposure, as a company, to China within our hedge fund investments.

What would make the most sense, and am I thinking about each measure correctly?

1. In terms of Gross exposure: Say my invested capital in a fund is $1,000,000, gross China exposure in the fund is 44%, and the fund’s total gross exposure is 266%. Would it make the most sense to say $1mm*2.66*.44 =$1.17mm would be the notional exposure to China? Or would I want to take gross China exposure as a *percent of total fund gross* and then apply that to invested capital to get an idea of the effective capital exposed (trying to take the leverage effect out) …like 44%/266%=16.5% and then $1mm*.165=$165k to say that, effectively, $165k of the equity invested is exposed to China once you “undo” the leverage?

1. In terms of net exposure: would I want to take net China exposure as a percent ent of fund NAV? Assume net China exposure is 30%. If my NAV is $1mm, does it make sense to say my net long exposure is $300k?

Another thing I don’t quite understand about all this is how could net exposure of invested capital be more than gross exposure?

Anyways - I’m clearly not understanding this well. Please help straighten me out. Thank you in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1j5cuxy/question_on_interpreting_leveraged/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1j5cuxy/question_on_interpreting_leveraged/

I have strong direct relationships with CIOs and heads of equities, derivs etc at most of the major funds as have been doing this for a while. 

What are your thoughts on the best way to approach you and build a relationship? 

I understand you get inundated with 100’s of messages from bad recruiters daily. I’ll be doing this for the next 20 years and my approach is just to get to know everyone in the market for the long term and add value whatever way I can - info flow, genuine advice on offers not through me etc. what goes around comes around. 

That said, what is most likely to get engagement from you? Obviously I work my network which is the best approach but if I need to get hold of someone who isn’t coming back to messages ultimately it comes down to desk dialling through bbg. That said, I get that you guys hate that and understand why. 

Would appreciate your views on how best to approach you. 

Furthermore - is there any broader value that could be added from my side that you guys don’t typically see aside from comp surveys etc that would differentiate a HH to you?

Hi all,

We all hear endlessly about how AI is going to revolutionise businesses globally, but it's rare to hear any real focus on which companies specifically are most likely to be disrupted and why.

As such, we recently used our AI analyst ([Primer](https://primerapp.com/)) to analyse more than 2,000 public companies and rank them by their vulnerability to AI disruption. Some fascinating patterns emerged that I thought would interest some of you.

Key findings include:

* Professional services giants like Cognizant and Accenture could see 50-75% of their business models challenged by AI (especially in code development and consulting)
* Traditional manufacturers surprisingly made the top 20 list - companies like Continental could see 40% of their business affected through AI-driven automotive tech disruption
* Media/content companies (WPP, Future) could see up to 65% of certain business units disrupted by AI content generation
* Financial firms show surprising vulnerability - banks and insurers could see their high-margin advisory work threatened by AI

We had[ Primer](https://primerapp.com/) analyse each company's divisions individually, looking at their reporting history and business models to generate disruption scores.

For full transparency - I work at Primer, and we're sharing this research to showcase our platform's capabilities. I would love to hear any feedback on the report or any other similar report types you would be keen to see.

2025-02-22 20:05:50,Genuine Question,kupman2002,0,"Recently had a conversation with a small private fund manager and some things were brought up to me that I questioned. He went into full detail about the obvious troubles of starting a fund and finding investors etc. 

I have a few questions that I’m hoping some you all could maybe explain because this manager couldn’t explain them and I have no idea why he couldn’t. 

As many of you are aware there are legitimate day traders that trade from home or office and are successful. What I mean successful is that they are profitable and rake in 10% to even 150% returns year in year out. Yes 150%. Why wouldn’t an individual like this take their knowledge to start their own fund that would quite literally blow competitors out of the water. Think about the best funds in the world. Haidar or Millstreet with returns of 20% + on average returns. To me that’s quite honestly horrible. I mean I personally trade and have reruns far greater than 20%. So really why don’t successful traders start their own fund? What limitations are there? To start ll have licenses or credibility but those are easily attainable with years of hard work. 

Is it more complicated than this? Of course im fully aware but historically hedge funds are that heavy on returns so why hasn’t they’re been a pioneer that has started one using their own strategy that proves to be far greater than any of the others?

I asked the manager, well what are your returns and he had mentioned roughly 7 to 8% this past year. I said wow that seems low and he took offense. I then mentioned there are day traders that make far better returns per year and he went on to explain that their strategies couldn’t translate to management and real time trading with that amount of funds. But why not? I can trade your strategy from home so why can’t you trade mine? What limitations are there? You can trade however you’d like white whatever fund you have the last time I checked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1ivrq0l/genuine_question/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1ivrq0l/genuine_question/
2025-02-22 14:43:18,What's the highest-T prop trading firm or Hedge Fund?,Richard-P-Feynman,14,"I work for a sell side firm in a role which is somewhat a hybrid between a Quant role and low-latency QD / data infrastructure engineering role.

On paper I'm a Quant Researcher, but rather than studying complex mathematical models (something that would actually be interesting) I'm solving latency engineering problems in a system which already exists and was written by some quants who apparently didn't know much about how to write efficient software. I mainly do two things. Fix slow software by replacing slow algorithms with fast ones, or by optimizing the software so that it runs faster, or I fix infrastructural problems, such as replacing one type of database with another one to improve performance.

I'm fine with what I'm doing at the moment. It's an easy job since there's no one else in the company with the skills to do this role, or with the experience I have on the technical side. 

Essentially, my job is pretty secure. I'm gaining experience on the Quant side, which is filling out my CV nicely. I'm able to make reasonable progress fixing some latency/data engineering issues with relatively little effort, and everyone seems to be impressed by my performance so far despite the fact that I know I'm underperforming.

Unfortunatly, I'm bored. I should be making 10x the progress fixing these data latency issues, but I am being inhibited by multiple factors. The most significant issue is that the software devs are obstructive. Most of them work remote. They hide information from my team, because they're afraid of losing their jobs. They're all completely incompetent. The level of stupidity is just astounding. These guys just can't make a simple, straightforward engineering decision. I think they are just incapable, out of their depth, and don't know what they are doing. Most of these guys appear to have been hired through nepotism.

What I've realized is, most of the people on my team are actually not that capable either. Most of my team are pretty much pure-quant. They don't really care about software. To be honest, I think they find writing software to be an annoying but necessary part of the job, rather than being something they are either interested in or enthusiastic about.

I have worked for a large number of firms in a short period of time. The only good firm I worked for was a backoffice/accounting software firm. Everyone there was extremely capable. The best of the best. Most of the other roles I've held I either quit after a short period of time, realizing it wasn't a good fit for me (aka no career progress or the company wasn't doing what I was interested in), or I was axed due to departments cutting headcount.

I left the backoffice firm to join a hedge fund, and later regretted it. I was hired by the fund to build out the first version of their trading platform. I enjoyed the work a lot, but as soon as I had got enough stuff working for the founders, they terminated my position there. To be honest, those guys were assholes. Not team players. They either didn't recognize talent, or didn't care about retaining talent. A valuable lesson I learned there was that some hedge funds are not be particularly interested in building stable technology. The technology is more of a tickbox for the investors. This particular fund didn't even care if the technology worked or did anything sensible. As long as it gave the appearance of doing something useful that was considered enough to pull the wool over the investers eyes in order to take their money.

Basically the point of all of this is to express that I'm bored and pissed off. The only thing I can imagine myself enjoying is working in some high-T environment, likely a prop trading firm or another fund.

I was curious to understand what are the key use cases and problem statements that hedge funds are tackling.

But I would love to know what kind of AI (and Gen AI) applications hedge funds are tackling right now.

With the SEC tightening cybersecurity regulations, there’s more pressure than ever to stay ahead.

But here’s the problem, many firms still rely on outdated security approaches, reacting after an incident happens rather than preventing it. 

That’s where a vCISO (Virtual Chief Information Security Officer) powered by AI can make a difference.

Instead of just checking boxes for compliance, it can:

✔️ Catch threats before they become a crisis

✔️ Streamline compliance reporting so you’re not scrambling before an audit

✔️ Monitor security 24/7, so nothing slips through the cracks

I am an autodidact with interests in economics and Python. 

I have developed a portfolio strategy using some economic ideas I developed. Using Python I trained some models on 10-year slices of market data to make dynamic reallocations (no more than once per day), and tested the models on the rest of the dataset.

Here are the relevant metrics over the past 20 years from my backtest for the most interesting model:

  
Annualized Return: 32.45%

Annualized Volatility: 0.1399

Sharpe Ratio: 2.3204

Sortino Ratio: 3.0788

Calmar Ratio: 1.7689

Max Drawdown: -18.35%

Obviously, I understand that nobody will invest unless I have some sort of track record, so I have now started paper trading for 1 month (4 weeks). So far I have 1 actual investor: me! And so far the results were pretty consistent with the backtest: I am up 4.98% and the SPY is up 1.94%. Strategy is long only and only using deep and liquid markets (treasuries, SPY, QQQ, GLD) and without buying any stocks in individual companies. And before you ask, no, I am not running n different models and just selecting the best one by Sharpe/CAGR, lol.

1) How long do I need to run paper trading before anyone in the industry will take me seriously? Where do I take my results if the results remain consistently good over the coming months/years?

2) I don't have a job in the hedge fund industry, or even one connected to the wider financial industry. What sort of job roles would you recommend I look to apply for? I have a BSc in data science.

3) Is it worth getting an MSc or PhD (maybe in finance?)

Costs spiraled.  
Hardware demand became unsustainable.

And suddenly? Scaling laws were quietly replaced with UX strategies.  
  
If scaling laws were scientifically valid, OpenAI wouldn’t be pivoting—it would be doubling down on proving them. Instead, they’re quietly abandoning the very mathematical foundation they used to raise capital.

Shameless self-promotion here, but when building a company it's simply what you have to do, and I didn't quite realise how big and active the hedge fund community was on Reddit.

As such, I thought it would be interesting for some of you to know a little more about [Primer](https://primerapp.com/).

We're a team of ex-analysts from both the buy & sell side (inc **UBS, Jefferies, MS, various L/S funds**) who wanted to build an AI platform that was genuinely valuable to hedge funds and asset managers, rather than just another 'AI chatbot' that generates basic summaries, with often questionable depth and accuracy.

Instead, Primer proactively sends you sophisticated reports containing analysis and insights on companies within your coverage, sent to you **within moments of earnings reports, calls and other news flow being released**.

These ‘Briefings’ contain **deep** ***reasoned*** **analysis** that factors in a company’s entire reporting history and **highlights crucial changes in guidance, tone, and outlook**, that human teams - without perfect memory and infinite time - typically miss.

Take a look at an example 'Briefing' [here](https://my.visme.co/v/mx0qmmgj-o7d0o7y#s1) as well as a couple of [videos](https://pitch.com/r/primer-feature-videos-wkyiaa) that will give you a better idea of how the platform works.

You not only receive ‘Briefings’ on your direct coverage, but **Primer also monitors your coverage's peers** to give you **real-time notifications of material, or even soft, changes** in trends.

We're currently working with several sell-side research teams at banks, as well as a variety of hedge funds in the UK and US.

If you would be interested in learning more or trying it for free, then shoot me a DM.

Alternatively, if you want to see Primer's most recent analysis for a company you cover, then just choose one from this [list](https://zikzj6wy24i.typeform.com/to/RH3pg7hv) and I'll shoot it over.

**Any feedback would also be massively appreciated** either in the comments or by DM.

I’ve been actively networking with funds and have had a few interviews with some of the more quantitative ones. What advice would you give someone trying to break into the buy side? Would it make sense to return to the sell side first and transition after a year or two?

2025-01-27 03:06:06,Starting a hedge fund from scratch,anmx02,12,"Hello everybody. As the title says and as it was asked here before, I have been thinking for some time about opening a hedge fund. With this thought came a lot of questions and fears regarding such a decision, and I wanted to ask some professionals from around here some questions about how to start and operate a hedge fund:

1. How much capital would it be recommended to have in order to start a hedge fund? Can you start a hedge fund with almost nothing, or do you need at least, let's say, 500k?

2. How lengthy is the registration process?

3. Dear fund managers and analysts, how do you find clients when you are at the very beginning? I find it quite hard to find clients when you are starting from scratch without having been previously working for a hedge fund / asset manager.

4. How stressful is the life of a fund manager?

5. How do you manage risk? What tools / software are you using for risk management?  

6. How does risk reporting to the clients work? How often are you making risk reports for clients (yearly, quarterly, monthly)? Did it happen that your clients asked for risk reports out of the blue?

7. Beyond strategies and elaborate thesis, what quantitative skills would be necessary? Is knowing Python(with Pandas and Numpy), R Studio, MATLAB, Java and C++ enough?

8. How complex is data management? For sure, it is complicated, taking into consideration cyber security concerns and large datasets, but I would love to read your opinions.

9. What are the most difficult aspects of clients and investors' management?

10. How are you dealing with complience and regulations?

11. For those bad days when you are losing money, how do you deal with it, and how do you get yourselves back on track?

12. How do I get the necessary equipment for trading? (Or from where can I buy). Like, those Bloomberg stations and keyboards, do you receive them upon buying a Bloomberg terminal subscription? Or is Bloomberg leasing them?

13. What's your opinion on activist investing? Is it worth it?

14. How do you find a good auditor? Do you trust Big 4 firms? 

For anyone who read until this point, thank you for your patience. I appreciate any kind of advice, and I'd love to hear your stories and learn from your experiences.

I, French M28, am currently working as a quant in a pod at a hedge fund (since Sept 24) in London. I would like to come back to France for good but I really like my job and don’t want to have to quit for that. My goal is to keep my job and work from France. The problem is, the company doesn’t have any office in France, so I don’t think they can move me to France with a French contract (I might be wrong). To me (assuming they agree to help me make the move because they don’t want to loose me), the only solutions are:
1. Make me a consultant with a French contract. I’m not a big fan of this because I would loose my company benefits and more importantly I don’t think I would be able to get my end of year bonus anymore (which can be quite substantial)
2. Keep me with my current UK contract and have me work from France but send me back to London on a regular basis. The frequency would be chosen so I comply with the minimum amount of time allowed outside of the UK. If what I say is true, I also don’t know what is that “minimum” here for the UK.

Is this really the case? Am I stuck until I get a green card. Surely many funds will back a different visa particularly if you’re in the USA already and keen to stay (less risk you’ll hate it and leave). Plus feels like the cost is so small to them and the wait time is even smaller than most non-competes.

2025-01-05 14:07:47,Buy side hiring environment? ,CFAWaffleFries,3,"I was curious to see what others had to say about the HF hiring environment. 

Background on me: 4 years sell side covering healthcare, 4 years buy side generalist, but 80% of ideas were in autos, consumer and TMT. Generated between and 15-25% in absolute returns over the 2 years I was picking stocks. Currently living in Denver. 

Background of the fund: ~$500m AUM, L/S and LO US small caps. Been around since 2004. 

The fund shut down in September (founders just wanted to retire and not performance related). We had known about it for a while, so I’ve been looking since about June for my next seat. It’s been tough, to say the least. I have been looking for analyst roles. 

I attributed the difficulty to the election uncertainty… is this just me? Do we expect it to improve in 2025? Or do I not have enough analyst experience (2 years) to be looking for another analyst role? Should I take a step back and target an associate role, with the goal of proving myself again to become an analyst?

2024-12-31 04:00:28,Funding in hedge funds,Messmer_Impaler,6,"I wanted to understand how funding works at market neutral hedge funds. Suppose a fund has $100 in cash. It borrows a further $300 as margin from its broker. With the $400 in cash, it wants to hold a market neutral portfolio, X long and X short. Typical margin rules for equity dictate that you can short around 50% of long equity kept as collateral. So cash funding for the X long, X short book should be X + 0.5X. Equating this to $400 suggests that a hedge fund could execute a market neutral book of GMV $533.3 while needing to pay interest on $300. If the fund can make the risk free rate on its GMV exposure, then its earnings should be (533.3 - 300)*risk free rate. Is this realistic?

2024-12-23 08:05:05,Finance GPT,jpolec,15,"We've built a FinanceGPT using a swarm from OpenAI with 8 specialized GPT agents, each focused on tasks like technical analysis, fundamentals, news, and market trends.

Unlike traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where a single model retrieves documents to answer queries, our multi-agent system works collaboratively, sharing context and insights in real-time. For example, if the Technical Agent detects unusual price volatility, it flags the News Agent to identify related macro events, while the Industry Agent checks if it's sector-wide or company-specific. This dynamic interaction ensures deeper, actionable insights.  
Here are some example queries for the multi-agent system:

1. **""Why did \[Stock Ticker\] drop 8% today despite strong earnings?""**
2. **""Is \[Stock Ticker\]'s high P/E affected by some news?""**
3. **""Which sectors are most affected by rising interest rates?""**

  
Here are some example queries for the multi-agent system:You may see video and code in Python at Quantjourney at substack: [post](https://quantjourney.substack.com)

Those are getting data from FMP - however we can connect more data providers - then it will be a case for prioritisation of data, which don't know yet how to approach. This technology is so cool, that it's even better than BloombergGPT made 2 years ago - hence probably they trained it much more, and have more precise results. Still work in progress..

2024-11-30 21:03:17,Did I botch it ?,pyrinc,2,"Recently pivoted out of my job in market risk covering fixed income at a BB on the sell side to a high growth fin tech start up doing sales. Took an initial base pay cut, but the trade off is equity in the startup as well as monthly high commission potential.

Spent 3 yrs out of school on the sell side and was looking for a switch to the buy side the last two years to do what I was doing/ pivot to a more junior PM role, made it to the last stage of a few interviews and was let down due to seniority.

Grew a bit frustrated with trying to find a job at the right fund and had an opportunity in front of me at the startup which I thought was stupid to let down, rather than stay on the same semi-predictable path in markets.

Now that I made the switch, I find myself missing working in markets and want to potentially still exhaust those opportunities I was seeking at HFs. It’s also too early to tell in my new role at the fintech startup. The question is, did I botch it and ruin my chances to ever be on the buy side?

*Should I go with a darwinex pro account?*

You are ""public""  and your performance is tracked.    One thing i can think off the top of my head is that you are not audited.  But a ""pro"" account basically looks very similar to a hedge fund.  You get fund documents, etc.  Its a UK audited FCA fund.    etc.  Raise your own money.  Costs are similar (maybe less), but more benefits in collecting revenue, etc.

What do you guys think of this as its less conventional method.  Draw backs?  pros and cons?   Anyone try this method?

Background about myself: 

I've been fascinated about finance since middle school, went through a bunch of rabbit holes, I invested into crypto, stocks w/o any knowledge, then got into trading CFDs, afterwards I heard about prop firms in 2020. I got mentored by a person who works in at a bank during 2020, collected data, became ""profitable"" trading. I got funded during HS using CFD prop firms, I got payouts, every payout 50% went into futures account just in case, met a few good traders and told me what to data to collect so I backtested again. This year I got booted off from the prop firm because I'm American and using CFDs is would be an issue to the prop firm, then I hopped on my futures account, since I had a solid back testing data and ""live"" data records (CFDs) I risked 5% per trade on my futures account, it went well, but then I wanted to learn how to start a HF, I did research, studied for licenses (failed), so during cooldown I realized risking 5% per trade and showing it to a client wouldn't be attractive. Then I back tested again properly which is the data im currently talking about, stressed tested my strategy it didn't do well (worst case was -18%). I do have to redo my futures track record and thinking of getting audited after 2 years of trading. I also do have in mind what prime broker to use once I get myself rolling.

I am still working on getting the exact number because withdrawals and deposits make it time consuming to calculate exactly but the total amount of money has increased over 15x.

So some background information on how this was done because those numbers do sound unbelievable at first. I am using concentration and leverage through options to get it. I have not spread the risk around like is typically advised. I have only allocate large percentages to companies that have ended being ranked towards the top of the market in performance.

I have a concentrated, aggressive portfolio that uses a lot of long term options contracts. My mode of operation basically comes down to doing a very large amount of research, finding a small number of stocks that are wildly misunderstood and preferably hated by both institutional investors as well as retail. I try to only invest in a select few areas I have a asymmetrical level of knowledge in my favor compared to the rest of the investors in the market. Most of my investing is long term holds of 6 months or longer. I do understand on a institutional level I would need to be more conservative and hedge my positions much harder...

I am currently working on gaining enough information to start a hedge fund seeder and eventually a hedge fund. I feel I am up against the clock on this though because I suspect in 1-2 years or less the huge advantage I have over the general market will start to shrink. Basically the cat will be out of the bag and while I still expect to be successful afterwards things will not be near as easy nor the performance anywhere close to as good.

Any way I want to strike while the iron is hot and take advantage of things while the competition is relatively light.  I have heard people say no one will take your personal portfolio seriously. Ok maybe at 25% gains but what about 7x in a year over multiple years? I am hesitant to go to family/friends over this because I don't want to mix my personal life up with business and large amounts of money part of me says maybe I should.. My main question is will anyone take this kind of performance seriously outside of people I have a relationship with or will I just be laughed out of the room?

2024-11-02 17:57:40,Finding Time To Do Modeling For Personal Investments,Silver-Sentence6293,7,"I've found it in the past to be quite time-consuming and tedious to do modeling for my personal investments (although I have wanted to) and this is quite a frustrating reality for many I've talked to aswell given that work and life is too busy to find the time.  The main time suck is manually looking through the filings to pull financials into my model which I'm sure many here can relate to.  It's especially difficult without access to tools like CapIQ, Bloomberg or FactSet to do this data pulling.

I decided a few months ago to try to tackle this problem with a friend of mine (both of us have CS backgrounds) and we created something that is now solving that quite well for us.  We made a tool that takes your excel modeling template and can fill in all the static input cells with financials from the filings that you upload to the platform using AI.  The AI understands your excel sheet via an excel add-in to know what to fill in and where, and then searches through the filings you uploaded to extract the numbers into each cell within just a few seconds.  The best part is that there's a way for you to verify where each cell result came from because we built an auditing pdf viewer experience that lets you see exactly where the number was found highlighted in text from the filing for any cell. 

I'm curious to hear if anyone has found other ways too to speed up their modeling processes for their personal investments.

Doctly wasn’t originally meant to be a PDF-to-Markdown parser—we started by trying to feed complex PDFs into AI systems. One of the first natural steps in many AI workflows is converting PDFs to either markdown or JSON. However, after testing all the available solutions (both proprietary and open-source), we realized none could handle the task without producing tons of errors, especially with complex PDFs and scanned documents. So, we decided to tackle this problem ourselves and built Doctly. While our parser isn’t perfect, it far outpaces most others and excels at parsing text, tables, figures, and charts from PDFs with high precision.

While no solution is perfect, Doctly is leagues ahead of the competition when it comes to precision. Our AI-driven parser excels at extracting text, tables, figures, and charts from even the most challenging PDFs. Doctly’s intelligent routing automatically selects the ideal model for each page, whether it’s simple text or a complex multi-column layout, ensuring high accuracy with every document.

With our API and Python SDK, it’s incredibly easy to integrate Doctly into your workflow. And as a thank-you for checking us out, we’re offering free credits so you can experience the difference for yourself.

3. **How important is data uniqueness and exclusivity?** – Do hedge funds care more about exclusive access to a dataset, or is it enough to offer unique insights derived from publicly available data?
4. **Are there specific industries or types of companies where alternative data is especially valuable?** – For example, does consumer retail data hold more interest compared to tech or healthcare?
5. **Any recommendations for structuring the data**? – For those of you who have sold data or have insights, what’s the preferred format or structure for hedge funds (CSV, APIs, SQL databases)?

2024-10-07 04:36:10,101/2 Lessons by Paul Marshall - Pragmatic approach to hedge fund management,Compoundingcapital10,3,"*101/2 Lessons from Experience* is written by Paul Marshall, co-founder of the highly successful hedge fund Marshall Wace, which has an investment model that combines fundamental and systematic equity long/short strategies. I find many of his ideas not only insightful but especially relevant to hedge fund management today. I wanted to capture some of my thoughts on his perspectives—both for my own reference and to share with my readers.

1. Who Really Believes in Market Efficiency

The author is very clear on his stance, but what caught my attention was that I've encountered numerous critiques of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), but few approach it from this perspective. He used the Mandelbrot’s theory of stock prices having memory and George Soros’ reflexivity theory to explain his point.

* Reflection: Behavioral economics and complexity economics present strong arguments challenging the market efficiency axioms of the Chicago School. Human behavior introduces complexity and non-linearity to markets that can't be fully captured by rigid axiomatic thinking. While the failure of many fund managers to consistently beat the market is often used as an argument in favor of market efficiency, it could also be viewed as a function of human behavior—where biases and cognitive limitations play a key role in underperformance. As a market participant, I have seen reflexivity work way too many times to ignore it. I would also highly recommend Mandelbrot’s book ‘Misbehavior of Markets’ to understand more about his work. While markets have been inefficient from time to time, I still feel that market structure changes all the time and hence it gets more and more difficult to beat markets and for most of us, passive investing might be the way.

1. Humans as Market Participants and Their Biases

Human behavior, both at the individual and collective levels, often deviates from rationality. Various behavioral biases influence investor decisions, complicating the concept of market efficiency. Paul Marshall highlights a few biases, of which I have highlighted four which I have found the most relevant based on my investing experience.

* Optimism Bias: This bias drives investors to overestimate positive outcomes and is a primary bias of momentum traders.
* Gambler’s Fallacy / Mean Reversion Bias: This bias leads investors to expect that asset prices will revert to their historical mean, encouraging a value-driven perspective.
   * Reflection: In my own investment approach, I try to combine both - while optimism bias is my default basis especially in constructive markets, I am always trying to counterbalance this by identifying pivots in market structure or individual stocks where mean reversion might occur where stock prices have deviated significantly from their intrinsic value, anticipating a reversal. If executed well, this blend of optimism and value-driven thinking can enable consistent market outperformance.
* Anchoring Bias: Fund managers often become anchored to what has worked for them in the past, showing resistance to evolving as market dynamics shift.
   * Reflection: Flexibility is essential in a constantly changing market landscape. Clinging to past successes can hinder adaptation and prevent investors from seizing new opportunities. Being mindful of this bias helps me avoid stagnation and keeps my strategies fresh. Since I invest on cross-asset basis, showing the flexibility to change allocation mix between bonds and equities been a key area of work to prevent anchoring bias.
* Disposition Bias: This bias causes investors to sell winners too early and hold onto losing positions for too long. It’s a widespread challenge, even among the best investors.
   * Reflection: This is one of the toughest biases to overcome. Warren Buffett's success lies not only in his ability to pick winners but also in his discipline to hold them as they continue to compound intrinsic value. He effectively ""hacked"" this bias by investing in companies that exhibit long-term growth, allowing him to ride their success without the temptation to sell prematurely. This is a bias I struggle with the most.

1. Concentrate and the Diversify

The author thinks about investing from a perspective of return for a unit of risk. Hence Information ratio (for long only managers) and Sharpe ratio (for hedge fund managers) are critical to understand the skill behind a fund manager. The author rightly points out that the best way to generate the highest risk adjusted returns is to ‘Concentrate around best ideas and then diversify to reduce risk’. Concentration increases returns and diversification reduces risk thus improving risk adjusted returns. Diversification, when used well (either at individual Portfolio manager level, or at the institutional level for a form hiring a bunch of PMs) can be a potent tool to increase risk adjusted returns and improve Sharpe ratios.

* Reflection: This lesson has a huge appeal to me as I am personally not comfortable with highly concentrated portfolios. I have gravitated to diversification while managing best ideas through slightly larger sizing. I generally concentrate in 10-15 ideas and then layer 15-20 ideas over it either as toe-holds or mid-sized positions. It allows me to sleep well and gives ideas that can move into the core group.

1. Long Term Thinking v/s Short Term Trades

Many of us are familiar with Benjamin Graham’s famous quote: “In the short term, the market is a voting machine; in the long run, it’s a weighing machine.” This thinking is often echoed by value managers who focus on long-term fundamentals. However, Paul Marshall provides a crucial insight: both short-term thinking and long-term patience have their place in investing. Multi-strategy funds like Marshall Wace effectively combine these approaches with their quant businesses leveraging short-term market movements to capture alpha while the discretionary fundamental PMs can take a longer-term view.

* Refection: Duration of trades is an important tool to create alpha. This resonates with my own approach to portfolio construction—being mindful of the duration of trades and diversifying that duration to achieve an optimal mix. This framework helps capture alpha while enhancing consistency over time. While as an individual trader, one does not have the quantitative resources, but it can be replicated by constructing some trades that are capturing more short term moves, while layering them with long-term thematic bets.

1. Seek change and go for ideas when they are half glimpsed and half understood

The author is a proponent of catalyst-based investing. Interestingly, he critiques the idea of holding high-quality companies long term, considering it an inherently lazy approach, especially in today’s markets. He argues that the competitive advantage periods for companies have become increasingly unpredictable due to rapid technological disruption and intensifying competition. This is particularly true when the cost of capital is low, making it harder to rely on long-term holding strategies without accounting for these shifts.

* Reflection: I call it pivot points in the market or in a stock. I'm constantly on the lookout for these moments of inflection. Identifying pivot points can be done using either technical tools or a fundamental approach. The latter tends to be more powerful, but when combined with technical analysis, it can lead to substantial profits.

1. Shorting stocks need a different approach and framework for success

The author presents a compelling narrative on shorts, emphasizing both the difficulty in generating alpha on the short side—particularly after accounting for costs—and the characteristics of a good short position.

* Reflection: In my view, timing is critical when it comes to shorting. Shorts are most effective when targeting companies in industries that are undergoing structural challenges or distress. Identifying these moments of vulnerability can greatly increase the chances of success on the short side.

1. Machines are Coming - If you can’t win, join them!

One of the major debates in the markets today is whether quant funds will replace fundamental investors. While quant funds excel at capturing factor-driven alpha, they can struggle during market regime shifts. On the other hand, fundamental investors can leverage data to make more informed decisions.

* Reflections: I've experienced the market regime argument firsthand through my investments in one of the Renaissance quant funds, which struggled to generate returns and significantly underperformed the market coming out of the COVID crisis. I am a big believer in passive investing for retail investors. As quant funds continue to dominate factor-driven strategies and institutional fundamental investors increasingly harness data to enhance their analysis and insights, it will become increasingly difficult for retail investors to gain a competitive edge.

1. Risk Management - Understand both Quantifiable and Non-Quantifiable Risks

The multi-agent, nonlinear complexity of markets makes understanding and mitigating risks a critical component of long-term success. The author moves beyond the Bayesian approach of quantifying risks, focusing instead on those that cannot be measured, what he calls emergent risks. He underscores the importance of viewing leverage and liquidity as essential tools for managing these unpredictable risks.

* Reflections: While simple in theory, many risk managers fall into the trap of obsessing over quantifiable risks, neglecting the role of human agency and reflexivity. As a result, black swan events occur with far greater frequency than normal distribution models predict. The insight of applying the uncertainty principle to risk management—identifying and contextualizing emergent risks—is, for me, the most valuable takeaway of the book. To this day, liquidity remains a key variable for me in my portfolio construction framework.

In conclusion, this is a short book with some deep ideas. It might not be a book for individual traders or investors (might be tough to appreciate it) - more relevant for PMs or analysts at hedge funds aspiring to be portfolio managers. I would give it a solid 4/5 as a finance book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1fxzly1/1012_lessons_by_paul_marshall_pragmatic_approach/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1fxzly1/1012_lessons_by_paul_marshall_pragmatic_approach/

Here’s a bit about my background:

* I’m in my final year at Babson College, studying Finance and Strategic Management, and I spent a year studying abroad at a top finance school in London.
* My internships have primarily been in wealth management and asset management, working for major banks in India. I’ve worked alongside fund managers, handled portfolios worth over $65M, and drafted investment strategies for high-net-worth clients.
* I’ve gained experience in research (low volatility and momentum strategies), portfolio management, and developing Investment Policy Statements (IPS).
* I’m passionate about eventually starting my own hedge fund and am currently seeking full-time analyst roles at hedge funds or asset management firms in the U.S.
* I’m aware of the challenges of being an international student, especially needing visa sponsorship (I’m on an F-1 visa), and I don’t have direct U.S. work experience yet.

I’d appreciate any advice on:

1. How to position myself as a strong candidate, especially given my need for visa sponsorship.
2. Best strategies for networking and connecting with hedge funds or asset management firms that are open to hiring international candidates.
3. Any specific skills, certifications, or knowledge that would make me stand out for hedge fund analyst roles.

\`

[Avinash | Instagram | Linktree](https://linktr.ee/SQ_Capital)

\`

EDIT - Answers to the questions raised in the comments. Thank you all for your valuable suggestions!  
\`  
AUM & Trading Approach:

The AUM for the returns I mentioned is $30M, and these returns are from live trading—not backtesting, as I don't believe backtested results are reliable or accurate to share.

\`

Metrics:

The Sharpe ratio for the strategy is 0.37. If you're interested in more specific metrics, I'd be happy to share them with you directly.

\`

Trading Style & Edge:

I primarily use speculative trading based on a combination of fundamentals and technical analysis. The edge I bring comes from partnering with over 20 solo traders and fund managers, allowing me to diversify risk and enhance returns through collaboration.

\`

Proving Strategy:

All returns are published on Myfxbook and are linked to a live account. I understand the importance of demonstrating the validity of these strategies, and I'm open to suggestions.

\`

Investment Minimums:

The $100k for individuals and $1M for institutions is meant to reflect different levels of engagement, but I acknowledge that my pitch deck needs refinement. It’s currently a work in progress, and I’m looking for guidance on how to polish it for better clarity and presentation.

\`

Service Structure:

At this stage, I’m offering managed account services, but the goal is to transition into a full fund over time. The fee structure is currently 30% for us and 70% for investors, and this will likely evolve as the fund grows.

\`

Experience & Team:

While I’ve only started raising funds this year after spending last year completing my learning, I have been sharing all my trades this year with investors and firms to build a solid track record. The combined experience of the team is over 40 years, with the most experienced individual having more than 10 years in the market.

\`

Regarding SQ:

As for the name ""SQ,"" it doesn’t refer to the futures term. It’s just a name I chose, and there’s no specific relation to market terminology.

\`

Combined P&L: 

The P&L is $30M, and all of my contact information, including links to Instagram, Twitter, and email, can be found on my Linktree.

2024-08-21 01:57:56,Anyone interested in joining a hedge fund incubator program?,mufasis,29,"

What’s going on hedge fund fam.

My name is Ryan. I’m 38 from Los Angeles.

I’ve been working on this idea for a while which came to me after I was mentored by a CTA. I met this individual purely by serendipity. He was a commodity broker for 20 years with experience running CTAs, CPOs and introducing brokers.

I had traded options and futures for over 10 years before meeting him. He helped me get my Series 3 and Series 30, also registered me with the NFA with two of his CTAs.

I learned SO much from this guy and the disparity between retail and institutional is staggering. There is no replacement for hands on real world experience from guys who have raised and managed millions. Not only from a structure and compliance view but also picking strategies to build trading programs around.

Typically the barrier to entry is very steep cause most hedge funds and CTAs do not train managers or CTAs, they hire phds and quants to do the heavy lifting on salary and bonuses but not sharing in the management fees or performance fees which are only available to CTAs and principal partners.

I’m in the process of creating a hedge fund/CTA incubator platform where I will teach all of this and help you get licensed, as well as fund and launch hedge funds and CTAs with qualified students. Of course you can launch your own fund and do it whatever way you want but I truly believe in the power of community and education.

The biggest set backs I see from my personal experience in this industry are understanding really how the business and compliance side works, and then of course the trading and capital raising itself. You can also fail really easy if you try to move too fast, if you manage to set everything up correctly and then lose client money it can really set you back.

I originally started this to find qualified people to become brokers and raise capital for my funds. This is a business where collaboration and uniting brilliant minds is where the magic really happens. So I wanted to create something that could facilitate this aspect of the business independently from the funds themselves.

After thinking about it and having numerous discussions with CTAs and brokers, this idea and the way I’m setting this up can have a much bigger footprint and impact than I originally thought.

One of the biggest barriers to entry is obviously capital, most traders right now rely on prop firms which really is only good for short term solutions as you can’t scale, and you’re extremely limited on applicable strategies, you also can’t retain a management fee.

There are several loop holes that allow you to manage capital for clients without any licenses or heavy compliance when you start, this is something we will utilize inside the incubator.

The great thing about this industry is you don’t even need to be a great trader to make a lot of money, you could strictly raise capital, or start a fund of funds where you allocate capital to existing CTA/CPO programs which are already profitable with experienced managers.

As an example, one of the CTAs my mentor knows is a young kid, he’s like 29 now, he started his CTA with 5m from friends and family, in 3 years doing mediocre returns, he has grown to 227m AUM. He makes about 400k a month in management fees and he made his clients north of 20m in the first quarter of this year, while making close to 4m in performance fees for that first quarter.

The scale and possibilities of this industry are truly limitless. I also believe in the power of community and education as there are some things I have learned that wouldn’t be possible without great mentorship.

If this is something you’re interested in, maybe you have criticisms or suggestions, shoot me a DM, would love to talk.

This community will be a place where all people, ideas and thoughts are given a chance to be heard.

Cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1exdm6e/anyone_interested_in_joining_a_hedge_fund/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1exdm6e/anyone_interested_in_joining_a_hedge_fund/

I’m currently a strategy consultant who is looking to eventually break into the world of hedge fund. I need your advice / input on how to get there.

I have a bachelor’s degree in business but with the concentration in finance. I went from management consulting and then strategy consulting. 

I did a bit of research and most of hedge fund only recruits mathematicians etc from top universities like Princeton, MIT etc, or those with IB / ER experience, or MBA at H/S/W.

I’m thinking about pursuing masters but my YOE is only about 3 years so it probably wont make sense to aim for MBA at H/S/W (however I’m at quite prestigious firm so H/S/W after 5 YOE is doable. But again, post-MBA careers are heavily impacted by pre-MBA so I don’t think I have good chance going that route given it’ll be 5YOE consulting without any finance work experience). 
Instead I’m thinking about MFin at e.g. U Chicago or equivalent and maybe go into IB, OR do MFE at NYU or Columbia or something like that.

2024-07-27 17:44:11,Big Returns On Established Track Record But Need Advice From Experienced Folks,PlungeLikeLivermore,5,"Hi all, I'm in the final stages of really putting a fund together. For some background...

I'm middle-aged and have been an avid trader for a very long time. I've always wanted to manage money but within the last 5-years my career has put me in a position that I feel has helped me mature to the point where I can be consistently successful.

Recognizing I was ""ready"" I decided to start formalizing a track record a bit more than a year ago. I opened a corporate account with IBKR and funded it with $140k of my own capital.

My returns have been extremely strong, yet volatile. In 2023 I returned 157% (July through December) and this year I'm currently at about a 40% return. My strategy is discretionary, repeatable, and scales.

I also have a lot of relationships with investors, but they are in the real estate world. I put together my tear sheet and short marketing deck and have started circulating it to some folks I'm closer with to gain feedback (and potentially soft commitments).

I've also had a couple conversations with the folks at Repool about fund setup and administration.

Here's where I'm struggling... fundraising!

Yes, it's early and I've only just started talking with folks but the reception has not been strong. Mostly, I believe I'm talking with the wrong folks. These are real estate people that generally don't trust the stock market. They are also smaller mom and pop type investors.

I know I will need at least $2MM - $3MM in commitments to justify spinning up the fund and I'm recognizing it will likely be a GRIND getting there. 

So I'm asking myself whether it makes sense to pursue that route or, perhaps, go the non-professional advisor route with IBKR. The logic here would be that I could take my time onboarding people individually. Then, once we get too big for that, or the fund size justifies it, I could transition to a full-fledged fund.

The other route is just grinding soft commitments to get me to the $2MM - $3MM point and hoping most are still wanting to commit when it comes time.

Any thoughts or advice from folks that have been there and done this would be much appreciated.

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1edm1pr/big_returns_on_established_track_record_but_need/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1edm1pr/big_returns_on_established_track_record_but_need/

2024-07-15 18:42:34,"CALLING ALL HEALTHCARE ANALYSTS, have you seen anything like this before? Share your thoughts below",Sad-Midnight-7386,0,"So I'm an investor in Indivior (INDV) - a small cap healthcare that's looks undervalued on a number of metrics and on sellside estimates.

Their main drug is Sublocade which came to market in 2017 and has grow very well. It's a long-acting-injectable for treating Opioid Use Disorder and has benefitted from the Opioid crisis in the US. It's active ingredient is buprenorphine which is an Opioid agonist and binds to Opioid receptors in the brain.

This drug competes with the daily oral and sublingual medications of buprenorphine which is what c95% of patients take vs c5% take Sublocade because it has to be administered once monthly unlike oral medication you take at home. Indivior has a generic oral on the market aswell called Suboxone. These treatments are for withdrawal symptoms and somewhat protects against overdose but isnt a real time solution if someone is overdosing. Narcan which is fast acting nasal or injection used for emergency overdose in real time. Indivior have a version for this called Opvee (nasal spray).

Anyway the company recently released an update stating there were discontinuing a schizophrenia mediation called Perseris (small % sales). They also lowered guidance for the year on the key drug sublocade, for a number of reasons including low customer stocking and removal of medicaid auto enrolment. Really the focus on this company revolves around the Sublocade growth story.

Market hated this and the share price fell around 30% on the update. The delta was about $100m less total group sales as revenue grow for FY24 as fell from 18% YoY to now about 8%. A key reason why the market didn't like it was because Camurus and Braeburn have a competing drug that was approved last year for the US market called Brixadi (sold in EU under Buvidal) which is arguably the same drug as Sublocade with a few different features.

So the market took this as ""management are seeing competiton now"" instead of reasons above - low customer stocking and no more medicaid auto enrolment. I think Management have been pressed by analysts on each earnings call since brixadi got approved in 2023 regarding pricing pressure or market share movements.

Now here's what I'm really interested in. A law firm is investigating and trying to find investor platifs who lost money from the announcement. Based on potential securities fraud ????? 

Link here - bgandg.com/indv/ 

I've never seen something like this, as this happen Oaktree Capital more than doubled their stake immediately after the selloff and are now the second largest shareholder. 

Why is a law firm investigating, isnt that the SECs job?

Did an investor approach the law firm first?

Does the law firm actually have evidence of securities fraud or something thay suggest management have defrauded investors?

Or did they notice something that could be fishy and post the investigation on their website hoping to find both platifs and evidence amongst investors that show investors were defrauded??

Never seen anything like this. The law firm also has won big settlements in the past but also if you go through their website they are ""investigating"" many small cap US equities.

Class actions and investigations link: 

bgandg.com/cases/ 

Has anyone seen anything like this before, personally the business looks undervalued and I think the concerns over the competitor aren't as severe as the market thinks for reasons I won't go into here. 

Are there any investment professionals that want to share their thoughts?

My background:

Age: 27

I'm getting my Bachelor's in economics now and will graduate next year. My GPA is 4.0. I spent my twenties running various educational programs as I've traveled the world, while also working with quite a few NGOs. I speak four languages (English, Spanish,  Portuguese, Russian) and could learn any others, given the incentive. 

Up until now, I've been trying to change the world as much as I could. But the harsh truth is this: money moves the world. The only way to really fix problems is to have the resources to do so. So I want to make money.

That motivation may sound dystopian, idealistic, or (somehow) both. But that's a bit of an aside from what I'd like to ask you all. I have a unique experience with the political and social elements of countries around the world - especially countries that Westerners tend to avoid. I believe that I could use that experience to predict conflicts, elections, coups, and major policy changes. My fund's niche would be investing in the companies, currencies, and real estate most likely to be affected by global events. 

Admittedly, I don't know any more than what Google has told me about getting a hedge fund job. So that's what I'm here to ask. 
- What internships should I be applying to? (E.g. Wealth Management, Global Investment, etc.)
- Would a CFA, Master's in Economics, MBA, or more languages be the most valuable education to pursue afterwards?
- How can I meet hedge fund managers or specialists who know about my niche?
- What's the best job to start out with? Financial Analyst? Financial Advisor?
- What else do I need to know?

2024-06-20 14:33:46,Deep Dive on the Do Kwon Saga: How he built Terraform Labs on lies and how he evades Justice,slurpeedrunkard,2,"Jump Trading, a Chicago-based hedge fund and Terraform Lab's silent patron and partner, was subpoenaed for documents and testimony in the civil fraud trial in New York.

In depositions, Bill Disomma, a co-founder of Jump Trading, and Kanav Kanya, the head of Jump Trading Crypto both assiduously pled the fifth amendment for every question beyond their address. And it’s not hard to see why – their behavior with regard to Do Kwon and TFL was shady, if not criminal.

Since they were not being charged, it seems like the SEC was trying to use their non-prosecution as leverage to make the group’s top officers cough up records, emails in particular, which they provided and which were later unsealed.

2024-06-05 06:10:32,My Thoughts On This SubReddit,KOZMOKreative,3,"I just stumbled onto the hedge fund topic sub here a few hours ago and spent that time going through many of the discussions. I have easily noticed some recurring things that I had some of my own thoughts toward and would like to put them out there (I hope that's okay with you all). My intention is merely to open up a conversation about these points and spark some impactful discussions regarding it all. I like to think posting this can truly bring some good insights out of it.

**Everyone is (pretty much) in the same boat**

First off, it is evident we can or have all beat the returns of the market index. However, it definitely seems like we are all in a similar catch-22 about starting an HF, being that we have a strategy we confidently believe in but have zero prospects of attracting high-wealth investors to partner with. I assume most of us are finding ourselves in despair about it too.

**There is lots of inconsistency about what the startup costs actually are**

Not only just here in this sub, but also all over Google, have I seen so much variation with what the compliance, registration, and regulatory costs are to be able to launch the fund. I have seen these expenses noted to be anywhere from $5k-$75k. These costs are essentially just coming from the act of filing paperwork with government authorities. From my experience with gov't charges, these filing fees will be the same across the board for the same types of entities. I get that the attorney expenses will be different, but not so much that everyone has wildly different expectations. I should mention that I believe we should be concerned with the *minimum cost* to get the fund active... In the business world we call this a minimum viable product. The additional costs like hiring a team of people are not even relevant here because we don't *need* them in order to start. Am I the only one who wants to get to the bottom of what the accurate figure is for taking the low-budget approach to doing these requirements? Is there anyone here who has already done this and can give us an accurate number? Furthermore, is no one else considering the possibility of negotiating the startup fees being covered equally between all partners involved? These investors are going to dish out $1M to get into the fund... I am sure an extra $5k each is not going to be a problem. 

**Many of us the people in this sub are overvaluing spending a few more years to get a track record**

Why are most people under the impression that an extra 4 years of managing a \[relatively\] valueless portfolio or incubator (yes... even $100k AUM is really *nothing* to the Mega-Millionaire target partners) is going to actually increase the odds of attracting investors? This is completely negligible to them. You're better off walking into their office tomorrow with nothing to show for and giving them a sales pitch they can't refuse. After all, filthy rich old dudes love a good business proposition that is delivered with passion, confidence, and knowledge. You will at least have their attention enough to carry on the conversation. AND you just saved yourself from wasting years of your life in vain. I think we should dive off the deep end sooner rather than later, chase our dream immediately, and just see what comes of it. 

**Finally... what's up with all the pessimism and cynicism going around in these threads?**

We are all in the subreddit for the same reason, with the same questions, and same hang-ups. How about we all be respectful and friendly with each other so we can work together to make our dreams come to life? These negative and plain rude comments at each other are uncalled for and are extremely counterproductive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1d8iz0q/my_thoughts_on_this_subreddit/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/1d8iz0q/my_thoughts_on_this_subreddit/

2024-05-26 00:40:46,Want to start a fund if I keep up performance. Any advice?,Big-Tailor5679,0,"I want to start a hedge fund in 4 years if I can continue beating the S&P 500. The issue is my account is not the largest (5 figures), as I contribute 15% of my paycheck to the account. 

I have been investing in the market since 14 years old. My first ever investment was a 6 bagger. Turning $4k from mowing lawns into $24k. Investing in a natural gas company prior to the fracking boom. This got me hooked. I haven’t been able to consistently invest because I have largely been a broke 20 something and always had to use money for LIFE. But when I have invested, it’s usually been a winner. 

My approach is simple and nothing novel. But my eye is tuned. I keep a very concentrated portfolio of no more than 5 stocks at any given time. I say NO to a lot of opportunities as they do not fall within my competence circle. I seek quality businesses with moats, in industries that I understand the WHY of a customer purchasing,  large growth prospects for the future, and at decent enough prices. Largely inspired by Charlie Munger and Mohnish Pabrai. 

Even when I was flat broke I read 10Ks for fun. Im known amongst friends and family as someone knowledgeable in investing. Which has granted me the opportunity to manage a portion of one of my father’s 6 figure IRA accounts. This account is doing well but not beating the market. I could have beat the market, but when we started it 2 years ago he was eager to invest the funds. So I chose investments right before an overall market decline. The account started at 400k pre decline and sit in the 450k range as of today. 

Im 32 years old today. I really feel this is my calling. If you were to ask those in my community what my calling is they would concur. As my advice has turned profitable since my teens. 

I’ve avoided my calling, and can’t stand the thought of avoiding it into the future. 

I want to start a hedge fund in 4 years if my performance stays consistent. I currently work a blue collar trade job which sustains me until then. 

How can I best prepare myself to attract capital to start a fund in 4 years? Is there any other general advice you may have?

2024-05-21 13:51:40,Compliance for a Hedgefund or Sales for Capital Market ,Effective-Salad6157,1,"Hi everyone, 

I am currently at the fork on the road of two very different career options. I have a background in data science, and recently, risk management in capital markets. I got an offer from a large data  company to sell capital market data as an SDR. $100k base + commission (still in the works to layout the detail of the commission structure). 

  
The second option, I am interviewing for a Hedgefund for a Compliance Assistant role that is offering base $110-120k, up to $130k with bonus. 

I understand the first option is unique because, this company isn't as well known as the parent company, and they have very valuable data that every bank, portfolio manager will need to do their trading. So I can see, myself selling the product really well, but I never done sales before and I am wondering if I will hate the sales cycle and outreach. 



The second option seems like a nice safe career, and growth. Not the biggest pay right away but lots of room for growth over the years. Since it is a junior level role, it's a good place for me to get acquainted with the work and become a SME. The fact that it's a hedgefund, also looks good on resume for future options. 

Not sure exactly how to pick and choose the best available option for myself here. What do you guys think?

2024-05-08 05:58:29,Hedge Fund Question,miotchmort,6,"I want to float a question by this group. I’m a portfolio manager for an investment firm, managing about $50 million (not as a fund but as separate accounts).  I’ve been researching starting a hedge fund for 7-8 years but couldn’t do it due to a conflict of interest and dual licensure issue with my current position. I think I’ve resolved all of that and am getting ready to launch an incubator.

I looked at my brokers hedge fund platform performance results and those funds were honestly way better than I would have thought. Based on that, I’m wondering if it’s even worth it at this point. Before I jump into it, I’m curious if my performance is even good enough to stand out against other funds. Please take a look at these results and give me your honest take on how this stacks up based on your knowledge / experience with US based hedge funds. (Average, below average or above average is fine). 

Overall  CAGR: 24.46% (net of fees) 
Fee structure: fixed 2% on AUM 
Max Drawdowns: -27.49% (2008/09) & -26.89% in 2022
Sharpe Ratio: 1.38
STrD Dev:17.70% 
Alpha: 17.30%
Beta: 0.8

Annual Results:
07=64.42%
08=-22.46%
09=84.19%
10=38.81%
11=0.6%
12=13.83%
13=46.54%
14=3.93%
15=35.01%
16=34.15
17=37.89%

19=40.92
20=52.29%
21=35.69%
22=-24.77%
23=67.69%
24 = 13.86% (year to date)

The fund can be scaled up to well over a billion dollars.

2024-03-26 15:24:06,Renting a Hedge Fund?,kimbo_m8,0,"Ever wondered if it's possible to use the power of a hedge fund without the usual barriers to entry? Let's dive into an opportunity that's opening up the world of hedge funds to a wider audience - and it's something that could potentially redefine passive income for ambitious investors.

**Enter the World of Hedge Fund Rentals**

What if I told you that there's a way to access the strategic might and financial leverage of a hedge fund without needing millions in capital? This isn't about buying into a fund with a hefty minimum investment. It's about ""renting"" the capabilities of a hedge fund, tailored to work for you.

**The QuantumCode Initiative**

QuantumCode is pioneering this groundbreaking approach. We've developed a platform that allows individual investors to tap into the prowess of hedge fund strategies, algorithms, and market maneuvering, all through a service that integrates seamlessly with your existing investment activities.

**Why It's a Game-Changer**

* **Accessibility**: This platform opens up hedge fund strategies to those who previously could only dream of such financial firepower.
* **Scalability**: Whether you're looking to enhance your existing portfolio or start anew, the platform scales with your ambitions.
* **100% Passive**: By leveraging advanced algorithms and strategic market insights, you're positioned to generate value in any market condition.

**Community-Centric Testing Phase**

We're in the final stages of beta testing and are inviting the Reddit community for an exclusive early look. Your feedback could help shape the future of retail investing.

**Join the Movement**

This isn't just about investment returns; it's about democratizing access to financial strategies that have been gatekept for too long. We believe in transparency, community, and the transformative power of technology.

If you're intrigued, skeptical, or simply curious, we welcome you to join the conversation. Dive deeper into how we're planning to make this vision a reality and how you can be part of this financial revolution.

**Let's Challenge the Status Quo Together**

The financial industry is ripe for disruption. By pooling our collective insights, questions, and critiques, we can steer this initiative in a direction that benefits us all. Your voice is crucial in this journey.

Interested in learning more and joining the dialogue? Check out our Discord for discussions, insights, and updates. Let's explore the possibilities together and turn the concept of scalable passive income through hedge fund rentals into a reality for the many, not the few.

2024-02-23 04:56:05,Finance & Investment Club SF Meetup,Possible-Share4373,8,"Hey everyone,

Would anyone be interested in a weekly meetup to talk about finance and investing? 

Some background on me: I graduated a few years ago with a finance and econ degree before going into investment banking at a boutique and then jumping to VC. I constantly read books and listen to podcasts about banking, private equity, the stock market and other areas. I have some friends from my hometown in adjacent jobs and I learn so much from talking to them about their job and how they’re seeing the economy and business landscape. Those conversations really helped me in my career and I want to build a community of people doing that in San Francisco.

Not looking to share confidential info or deal flow, just looking to talk about finance and investing with juniors in the industry (senior associate and below preferably). Juniors do a lot of the grunt work and have a lot of really interesting work experience. I’m working on building a community where junior folks in finance and investment roles can learn about adjacent areas and talk about all things finance.

2024-02-20 17:08:35,Hedge fund Account Math Question...,mistressbitcoin,3,"Can someone explain to me the logic of the following scenario?:

2 investors into the fund:

Investor A: $100k  
Investors B: $100k

End of year 1:

Investor 1: 80k (20k unrealized loss)  
Investor 2: 80k (20 unrealized loss)  
NEW Investor 3: 80k

In year 2, only one trade was made, for a short term profit of 15k, unrealized loss recovered a bit, so that A and B are only down 10k on that portion.

End of year 2:

Investor 1: 95k (10k unrealized loss, 5k realized gain)  
Investor 2: 95k (10k unrealized loss, 5k realized gain)  
Investor 3: 95k  (10k unrealized gains, 5k realized gain)

I would assume, in this scenario, that each person should pay taxes on the 5k of realized gains. Right?

Wouldn't that be the correct way?

Unfortunately it is wrong, and Investor 3 gets stuck with > 5k of gains because of equalizing disparities or something. I do not understand why there are any complications to the above.

**What's the Big Deal?** We're not just talking about another trading platform. This is advanced, integrated technology designed for serious traders, blending seamlessly with WordPress. It's powered by QuantumCode's sophisticated algorithms. To put it into perspective, our QC index (a dynamic mix of strategies) transformed 10k USDT into 240k since February 2023 – and it didn’t even break a sweat during global upheavals like the pandemic. 

**Why you should get us to know?** With us, you’re adopting methodologies that have been refined and proven over years. It’s about leveraging a system tested with millions of dollars and designed to cover all market conditions profitably.

Now, here's where it gets really interesting for you guys. We're about to go live, but before we do, we're in the final stages of testing with our community members. And I thought, who better to invite for an exclusive early look than the Reddit community?

I'd love for you guys to be among the first to try this out and see what you think. We’ve set up a Discord, and I think you're really going to like what you see. Here’s the link to join us: [https://discord.gg/ZtFC9az5a3](https://discord.gg/ZtFC9az5a3)

2024-02-08 20:09:04,Ken Griffin: The Maverick Investor Changing the Game (complete on my substack),Blacjupiterrr,2," 

Ken Griffin was desperate for a satellite dish, but unlike most 18-year-olds, he wasn’t looking to get an unlimited selection of TV channels. It was the fall of 1987, and the **Harvard College** sophomore urgently needed up-to-the-minute stock quotes.

Why? Along with studying economics, he happened to be running an investment fund out of his third-floor dorm room in the ivy-covered turn of-the-century Cabot House. Therein lay a problem. Harvard forbids students from operating their own businesses on campus, but he still got the authorization and this was the start of a great story.

Griffin was born on October 15, 1968 in the state of Florida, in Daytona Beach County. As a teenager, during his time at Boca Raton Community High School, he served as president of the math club. This particular trait would define the way he made his fortune.

His interest in the market dates to 1986, when a negative Forbes magazine story on Home Shopping Network, the mass seller of inexpensive baubles, piqued his interest and inspired him to buy some put options.

Miffed at the size of the broker’s fees, he ambled over to the Harvard Business School library and read up on finance theory. He soon built his own convertible bond pricing mode.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0oruhpkp4fhc1.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c14a976294d429ff8464d829ef2759ccaff65f1

 

Returning home to Florida during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years, Griffin visited a broker friend working at the **First National Bank** of Palm Beach and began to discuss his new model. A retiree named Saul Golkin walked into the office and listened in as Griffin explained his theories about trading converts.

After 20 minutes, Golkin said, “I’ve got to run to lunch. I’m in for 50.” At first Griffin didn’t understand. Then the broker explained that Golkin had just agreed to invest $50,000 !

Emboldened, Griffin quickly raised a $265,000 limited partnership **( that’s worth about $682,000 today when adjusted for inflation )**— whose investors included his grandmother — called **Convertible Hedge Fund #1**

With the $265,000 dollars he managed in his fund, he managed to benefit from the **Black Monday of 1987**, which allowed him to deliver profits to those who trusted in his talent and, in addition, to start managing a second fund.

In 1989 he graduated from college with a degree in economics and a reputation that attracted the attention of a famous manager of the time, Frank C. Meyer, founder of Glenwood Capital, who decided to test Griffin’s expertise by giving him a million dollars to manage.

In response, Ken Griffin far exceeded expectations by delivering a **70% return** within a year. This feat earned him the interest of several firms to back him and provide capital for him to manage and grow.

 

### Citadel LLC: building an empire

As a result of this great first year return, Griffin founded **Citadel LLC** on November 1, 1990, in the Illinois city of Chicago, with an initial capital of $4.2 million, and is today one of the largest hedge funds in the world.

At first, Citadel traded only U.S. convertibles, Japanese convertibles and warrants — lucrative trading arenas in the early 1990s.

>“In the early 1990s, if you knew how to model a bond, you could make a lot of money,” says convertible bond chief David Bunning, a onetime Harvard wrestler who joined Citadel as its sixth employee in 1991. Griffin hired inexperienced college graduates and even interns as he gradually expanded.  
**“It was a global arbitrage shop run by a 22-year-old,”** says Bunning.

Griffin’s youth showed. Former employees recall that he was forever challenging Citadel traders to defend every nuance of their positions and personally running them through pointed grillings at regular trading meetings

**“From day one, the goal was always to build the best independent trading firm,”** says Griffin. ***“If you make $100 million at another hedge fund, you are a god. If you make $100 million here and someone down the street makes $400 million, you’d better be thinking about why you didn’t make $500 million.”***

Such competitiveness is not uncommon in the hedge fund world, but what sets Griffin apart, and just might secure his reputation, is an absolute mania for management. Though a first-class trader himself, he walked away from the convertibles desk years ago to dedicate himself totally to building the business and creating an institution with a solid infrastructure.

That’s something investors like Julian Robertson and George Soros tried to do too late Griffin has done this by hiring talented executives and instilling in his troops his obsession with systems and analysis.

Unusual for hedge funds, he has brought in professional managers from places like **Andersen and Boston Consulting Group**. He built an internal stock lending operation in the late 1990s to allow Citadel to fly below Wall Street’s radar.

By 1994, Citadel had expanded to **60 traders and analysts**. However, the bond market witnessed a historic decline that year, causing several hedge fund closures across the board. In a panic, Citadel’s clients withdrew about a third of their capital, resulting in a 4.3% decline for the fund. That marked Citadel’s first down year.

2024-01-28 16:23:27,HedgeFund Manger,New-Performer-3717,9,"Hello All,

&#x200B;

Love to answer questions about getting started with hedge funds. It seems after scrolling through the thread most are more interested in creating one than investing in one.

&#x200B;

(Background) I created my fund awhile back. Was always in the space. My closes friends were Hedgefund managers. I also had an above average track record for years on my personal portfolio. One of the funds tried to hire me on and instead ending up helping me create my own cause we were close friends.

(Fund) Total return, long term capital gains equity fund. That means I dont do anything that causes short term tax for investors. Standard 2/20 fee structure. All fundamental investing. I do not diversify at all. One to three stock at any given time is more than enough.

(Creating the fund) Structuring the businesses was interesting. I did it all on my own with help of other managers and lawyers. This means PPM, Subdues, fund type there are two main type for equity (506B and 506C) as well as tax preparations.

(Information) I use interactive brokers. Fund admin is Nav consulting. Lots of questions on here about fund admins there are only a few Nav is the most well known. Very small piece to the puzzle but its important.

&#x200B;

(Lastly for those who are wanting to create a fund without getting absolutely milked by a law firm for setting one up in the future I will sell a package and advise people how to go about creating one and walk them through the process. With help you can get one built sub 50k. Going though a lawyer your looking at 250k alone for the PPM of quality and Buiness structure will be another 100k plus. Ive gone down both roads it’s about 500k all said and done working with a law firm. They are trash in my opinion and take advantage of the fact nobody actually knows how to lunch a hedge fund but a select few so they try and sell there advisor as something magical. Will experience if your intelligent and motivated and do it yourself mostly it takes about 4 months to launch a fund.

2023-12-26 15:18:53,Is HSW MBA worth it if I want to pivot into buyside with no prior experience?,applepie0007,2,"I'm so grateful to have gotten an offer from Wharton for the class of 2026, but I have a hard time deciding if MBA is worth it.

I want to pivot into buyside, more interested in doing investment research (like fundamentals) than trading. 

I have been working at a big name CIB as a strategy consultant (think what MBB will do: strategy planning, process improvements, etc.), so there's no deal experience, no equity research work, no due diligence work involved.

I have heard pivoting into buyside depends HIGHLY on your pre-MBA work experience and it is almost impossible to get an offer without IBD, ER, or other buyside experience on your resume.

I'm 25 (will be 28 to start a FT job if I go to Wharton), F (idk if that makes it harder in this industry), and need sponsorship (5 years remaining on H1B, heard it's hard for buyside to sponsor).

I got a pretty generous fellowship from Wharton (not a full ride), so I won't need to take out any loans, but it will most definitely deplete all my savings.

I'm also hesitant to ""aim lower"" and go into IBD. My current company is flexible with internal mobility and I have the opportunity to join an IBD coverage team in 2024 if I don't go to MBA in the same year. However, IBD isn't strong at my current company (even though the company itself is well-known), so I'm worried that without the MBA platform, it would be difficult to go from there to buyside in 2025 even if I'll have 1yr IBD experience.

Personally, I'm leaning towards going to Wharton bc my undergrad is a T30, not that competitive in a sea of ivy undergrads. But I want to be more objective with my decision. Should I take the chance and go to Wharton? If so, what should I start studying for / preparing for the recruiting season? There's CFA level 1 exam in Feb, would taking that help? 

Sorry for the long post. Any insights from current MBA students with the same goal or anyone at buyside would be highly appreciated!! Thank you so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/18raar5/is_hsw_mba_worth_it_if_i_want_to_pivot_into/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/18raar5/is_hsw_mba_worth_it_if_i_want_to_pivot_into/

2023-12-19 21:00:23,Advice For Aspiring Professional - Hedge fund/Investment fund,HaitianWreck,7,"Hi guys, I am new here. I apologize in advance if my ignorance baffles some of you, but I am excited to learn form this community. 

To make a long story short, I grew up in Haiti and was able to get my undergraduate degree in BBA at Emory University, which already puts me well ahead of almost all of my peers from Haiti. 

Now, I am trying to take it to the next level and shooting for the moon (even if I end up landing somewhere on the clouds). 

I spent the last 6 years doing IT Audit - The Audit of IT Infrastructure and Information Systems. 

This past year, I applied to business school with a 710 on the GMAT and got in Wharton Lauder but ultimately passed on it due to the program costing 230k (I know some of you guys will grill me for not going). After re-applying to business school, I am landing with a full ride at U. Chicago Booth. It seems that HE are lathered with H/S/W post-MBA candidates, so I am trying to carefully craft my plan between January and September to start building a foundation for HE and stand out amongst the competition. 

Here is what I came up with and that is where any advice or help would be so helpful:

1. Work a finance internship in a Financial institution in Haiti from January to the summer 2024 (smaller IB market). 
2. Find an IB Pre-MBA internship over the summer with a US based bank.
3. Recruit for IB/PE Middle Market Firms in Chicago/IM firms.
4. Get my FMVA (Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst) certificate for IB and PE recruiting
5. Clear Level 1 CFA before school starts for IM.
6. Finish my CFA within the next 3 years

After doing research, I could also work on a masters degree in Finance/Data Science/Computational Science from Harvard or purpose a PhD in Economics or Statistics part-time at whatever institution I can get in. 

I know my life is going to be hell for the next 10 years or so, which I am ready to embrace. I just want to know if it even makes sense or are there fundamental things that I am missing.

I appreciate any feedback - positive or harsh. I rather hear it now than 5 years into this.

2023-12-16 10:28:47,Medallion Fund. Is all true? Doubts,AntonioMariaBarbieri,144,"Recently I spent many days understanding the Medallion Fund (Renaissance Technologies by J. Simons) but I don't understand how it is possible to beat the market for over 30 years with a performance x3 or x4 times the market.   


Mathematics. Smart people. Artificial intelligence. Algorithms. Nobody can invest in it. Mystery. Almost magic. All very vague. But it all sounds very cool.    


The question is: how?    


It's not a conspiracy, sincere and respectful question.    


Could it be fake? A Ponzi?    


I want to read your opinion.    


My doubts are:   


1. They don't have a negative return. For example, every time the SP500 was negative the Medallion Fund's return was positive by much more. Sometimes x2 or x3. It can happen in the financial world but that it always happens seems strange to me. (Leverage x5,x10?)  

2. Renaissance Technologies' public funds are as good as any, with ups and downs. Instead the ""secret"" one, the Medallion Fund, always positive return.  

3. Mystery. Employees can't talk about how they make money. The money is managed internally without having external inputs. Warren Buffett is transparent about everything. For better or for worse, you find his companies where invest, you know his investment philosophy, his mistakes and his victories. Here you find only victories.  

4. The financial media constantly praises him but no one has ever questioned him. All speeches and questions are ""fantastic team"", ""mathematics"", ""quantum strategy"". Very generic.  


Again, this is just curiosity about Medallion Fund, nothing else.

I'm really keen to hear how you guys are using (or planning to use) AI to make things tick better. Whether it's about smarter risk management, next-level trading algorithms, or just making clients happier with some AI magic, I'm all ears.

Here’s a quick rundown to get the ball rolling:

2. **Algorithmic Trading:** Anyone using AI to predict markets and make smarter trades?
3. **Client Relationships:** Any cool AI tools making your clients feel like VIPs?

Basically, I'm fishing for any nuggets of wisdom or cool stories you’ve got on AI in our field. What’s working for you? Hit any bumps along the way? Think AI's going to be a game-changer soon?

**1. Structure:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are mainly structured as private investment firms. They are not as regulated when compared with mutual funds; in fact, this gives hedge fund managers more freedom in terms of their investment strategies and the asset classes they invest in.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are regulated investment companies; they are typically structured as open-end investment companies. They are heavily regulated by the Securities Board.

**2. Investment strategy:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds employ a wide range of investment strategies and techniques like long and short positions, leverage, derivatives, and other investments. They aim to make high positive returns regardless of market situations, and they have the flexibility to short-sell assets to profit from falling prices.

Mutual Fund: Mutual funds are designed for retail investors, and they follow traditional investment strategies like buying and holding stocks, bonds, and other securities.

**3. Liquidity:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds often have more restrictive liquidity terms. Investors have limited opportunities to withdraw their funds, such as withdrawing their investments only at a specified time, such as lock-up periods or notice periods for redemptions.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are generally more liquid. Investors can redeem their shares even daily at the Net Asset Value (NAV) price.

**4. Fees:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds charge both management fees and performance fees. Management fees are charged for the assets under management (AUM), and performance fees are a percentage of the profits generated. These fees can be very high.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds charge management fees, but they are low compared to hedge funds, and they also do not charge performance fees.

**5. Regulations:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are less regulated compared to mutual funds. They have more freedom compared to mutual funds but carry a higher risk.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are heavily regulated by the Securities Board and must adhere to strict investment guidelines and reporting. The regulations are there to protect the investments of retail investors.

**6. Investor Eligibility:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are open only to accredited investors and institutional investors, like someone with an investor profile or high-net-worth individuals, pension funds, and endowment funds. They have high minimum investment requirements.

Mutual Funds: Mutual Funds are designed for retail investors and are accessible to a wide range of individuals. They have minimum investments and are open to the general public.

**7. Transparency:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are less transparent regarding their holdings and strategies. Investors may not have real-time visibility into their fund’s positions.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are also not transparent, but when compared to hedge funds, they are a lot more transparent; they disclose their holdings and strategies to investors.

**8. Risk Profile:**

Hedge Funds: Hedge funds are riskier investments as they use leverage and alternative risky strategies. They aim to make high profits but also carry higher risks.

Mutual Funds: Mutual funds are known as low-risk investments, suitable for investors with a more conservative risk tolerance.

Hedge funds and mutual funds differ significantly. Hedge funds are designed for more sophisticated investors seeking higher returns, which come with high risks. On the other hand, mutual funds are designed for the general public and are more straightforward investments with lower minimum investment requirements ",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/17ef4o3/difference_between_hedge_funds_and_mutual_funds/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/17ef4o3/difference_between_hedge_funds_and_mutual_funds/
2023-10-20 04:42:16,Best investment medium to short private equity multifamily,Leather-Rain615,1,"I have been underwriting a large number of multifamily properties (200-300 units and above), largely in the sunbelt markets and the asset class continues to make little sense to me from a total return perspective, especially in the private markets. I understand there are tax benefits, but that aside, I still think pricing in this space is quite frothy. What's the best way/medium to short this asset class? Unfortunately, pricing in the public markets for this asset class makes more sense, so I don't think shorting those names would be as lucrative.

2023-10-18 02:20:18,I'm an experienced software engineer and I'm wondering whether I should join a crypto trading firm.,Aureliano_pp,4,"Hope I can get some solid advice here.

So I've been working as a software engineer in several tech startups, and I've applied for Jane Street & Citadel earlier but failed to get any offer. Now I have the chance to join a proprietary trading company that deals cryptocurrency as a trading system developer (or quant dev, not quite sure yet). I'm wondering if this sort of company (small, crypto, but the technology is supposedly good) is worthwhile to join as the start of my career path in the financial tech area? Can I still apply for big companies like JS, Citadel, Jump with such experience of my resume, would it be a plus or not?

I do have the opportunity to go into some other famous tech company (not FLAG level though). Which shall I choose so I have better chance at reapplying for those significant hedge funds?

2023-10-08 21:33:34,Career advice,Personal_Produce7054,3,"Hello guys, I'm typing here to ask for some suggestions to find a job into a hedge fund in the US.

I have a bachelor in mechanical engineering and I'll get a master in energy engineering next month at politecnico di Milano with a GPA of 4.0. I have good coding skills (my thesis project is an optimization algorithm in Matlab) and know well MS office, but I don't know python. 

I have two internships for a total of more than one year done while I was studying in two different italian companies, one in the chemical field, one related to the decarbonization of ammonia plants(hydrogen and renewables). Moreover recently I started a short master in blockchain and digital assessore.

Do you think that with a similar profile I may be able to get some interviews even as an intern, or should I make some experience in consulting  or something else before?

I am interested in the markets and I think that maybe equity research would be my first choice, but I am not very sure about the different possibilities in terms of career paths in this sector. Another thing that sounded interesting is financial engineering, but I would not do another master rn.

Do you have suggestions in general?",https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/173alwv/career_advice/,,https://www.reddit.com/r/hedgefund/comments/173alwv/career_advice/
